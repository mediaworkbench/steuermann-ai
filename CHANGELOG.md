# Changelog

### [0.4.0] — shadcn-ui-migration

**Icon System — Material Symbols → lucide-react**

* **Hard cut:** Replaced all 71 Material Symbols Outlined icon usages across 32 source files with direct `lucide-react` imports. Deleted `Icon.tsx`, the `MaterialSymbolsOutlined.woff2` font asset, and the `@font-face` / `.material-symbols-outlined` CSS. Created `lib/iconMap.ts` for dynamic string→icon resolution. Added ESLint rule blocking `material-symbols-outlined` CSS class. Updated `docs/design_system_directive.md` for the new icon policy.

**UI Primitives — shadcn/ui adoption (Phase 2 & 3)**

* **Replaced 7 existing primitives:** Button (CVA + `@radix-ui/react-slot`, `@base-ui/react/button` removed), Input, Textarea, Checkbox (`@radix-ui/react-checkbox`), Slider (`@radix-ui/react-slider`), Select (native `<select>` styled), Dialog (migrated to shadcn `<AlertDialog>`, then deleted). All files renamed from PascalCase to lowercase (`Button.tsx` → `button.tsx`).
* **Installed 15 new shadcn components** via `shadcn@latest add`: `alert-dialog`, `avatar`, `badge`, `card`, `dropdown-menu`, `label`, `popover`, `separator`, `sheet`, `skeleton`, `sonner`, `switch`, `tabs`, `tooltip`, `alert`. All backed by `@base-ui/react`.
* **20 ui/ component files** (all lowercase, `dialog.tsx` deleted): `alert-dialog.tsx`, `alert.tsx`, `avatar.tsx`, `badge.tsx`, `button.tsx`, `card.tsx`, `checkbox.tsx`, `dropdown-menu.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `label.tsx`, `popover.tsx`, `select.tsx`, `separator.tsx`, `sheet.tsx`, `skeleton.tsx`, `slider.tsx`, `switch.tsx`, `tabs.tsx`, `textarea.tsx`, `tooltip.tsx`.

**Product/ Layer Simplification (Phase 4)**

* **Deleted 6 thin wrapper components** — consumers now import directly from shadcn `ui/`: `SectionCard`, `TitledSectionCard`, `SectionHeader`, `FormFieldLabel`, `SegmentedTabs`, `PanelLoadingState`.
* **Deleted 13 more business-logic wrappers** in two audit sub-steps, replacing with inline JSX: `SectionErrorText`, `SectionStateText`, `DangerHintText`, `DangerActionButton`, `LabeledValue`, `PrimarySaveBar`, `SubsectionHeader`, `SectionPanel` (Step 2a); `TonePill`, `PageShell`, `PageHeader`, `PageErrorAlert`, `MetricsLoadingState` (Step 2b).
* **38 product/ files remain** — real business-logic components (not thin wrappers), not in scope for deletion.

**Dialog Migration**

* `ConfirmDialog.tsx` rewritten to use shadcn `<AlertDialog>` + lucide `AlertTriangle`/`HelpCircle` icons with a `confirmedRef` guard preventing double `onCancel` dispatch.
* `ExportDialog.tsx` migrated from legacy `DialogSurface`/`DialogCard`/`DialogHeader` to shadcn `<AlertDialog>` with lucide `Download`/`FileText`/`Code2` icons. Deleted `dialog.tsx`.

**CSS Infrastructure**

* Added shadcn CSS variable aliases (`--color-ring`, `--color-input`, `--color-card`, `--color-popover`, `--radius`) in `globals.css` `@theme` block.
* Added missing `@theme inline` block from `shadcn/tailwind.css`; fixed `@custom-variant dark` to target `[data-theme="dark"]` instead of `.dark`.
* Removed circular `--font-sans: var(--font-sans)` from `@theme inline`.
* Added missing shadcn CSS vars (`--card`, `--popover`, `--input`, `--ring`, `--chart-*`, `--sidebar-*`) to both `:root` and `html[data-theme="dark"]`.
* Removed Google Fonts Geist import.

**Dependencies**

* Removed 9 unused packages: `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`, `@radix-ui/react-label`, `@radix-ui/react-popover`, `@radix-ui/react-select`, `@radix-ui/react-separator`, `@radix-ui/react-switch`, `@radix-ui/react-tabs`, `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`. Lockfile pruned 31+ transitive packages.
* Remaining Radix: `@radix-ui/react-checkbox`, `@radix-ui/react-slider`, `@radix-ui/react-slot`.

**Verification**

* `npm run lint` — 0 errors, 0 warnings.
* `npx tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors.
* `docker compose build` — all 4 images (nextjs, fastapi, langgraph, ingestion) build clean.
* Frontend Jest — 12 suites, 88 tests all passing.
* Backend pytest — 1082 passed, 1 skipped, 36 deselected (no regressions).

### [0.3.9] — design-system-foundation

**Core UI & Design System (Phase 2 & 3)**

* **Radix & Shared Primitives:** Established the Phase 2 design foundation using Radix UI and Tailwind (`clsx`, `cva`, `tailwind-merge`). Built and integrated core shared controls (`Button`, `Input`, `Dialog`, `Checkbox`, `Slider`, `Select`, `Textarea`) across the entire app.
* **Component Extraction:** Extracted redundant UI code into shared, domain-specific primitives. Standardized application shells (`AppShell`, `PageShell`, `WorkspacePanelShell`) and unified repeating patterns across the Settings, Admin, and Workspace panels.
* **Metrics & Analytics Standardization:** Completely rebuilt the Metrics and Analytics dashboards using shared chart, stat, and control-strip primitives. This standardization allowed for the complete removal of legacy, route-specific CSS (e.g., `Metrics.module.css`).

**Theming & Tokenization**

* **Semantic Color Sweep:** Eliminated hardcoded hex values and legacy color palettes (e.g., `pacific`, `evergreen`, `emerald`) globally. Replaced them with a strict, semantic CSS-variable token system (`primary`, `surface`, `destructive`, `success`, etc.) to guarantee 1:1 Light/Dark mode parity.
* **Typography:** Added local Geist font assets and set it as the global UI font.
* **Map & Chart Sync:** Tokenized the `MapWidget` and analytics charts so their colors dynamically resolve to the active theme/profile CSS variables.

**Localization & i18n**

* Expanded translation coverage (EN/DE) across the Workspace (version history, lightbox, document actions), Admin profile metadata, and Map overlays.
* Moved hardcoded user-facing toast messages and errors to the `useI18n` flow.

**Tooling, Linting & Workflow**

* **ESLint Guardrails:** Added strict linting rules to enforce the design system. The pipeline now blocks raw status-color class strings and direct `lucide-react` imports (enforcing the shared `Icon` wrapper).
* **Testing Pivot:** Confirmed a manual E2E validation strategy for this cycle, removing Playwright dependencies to streamline the repo.
* **Documentation:** Updated `design-system.md` handoff snapshots to reflect the completion of Phase 1/2 and clarify remaining Phase 3/5 work.

## [0.3.8] — workspace-panel-evolution

### Workspace — Modular Tabbed Panel

- **feat** The monolithic right-side workspace sidebar (909 lines) is now a modular, tabbed
  `WorkspacePanel` (`frontend/src/components/workspace/`) with five sections: **Documents**,
  **Knowledge**, **Memory**, **Outputs**, **Inspector**. `WorkspaceSidebar` is kept as a thin
  backwards-compatible wrapper, so the `ChatInterface` mount and the Header toggle are unchanged.
  Editor and version-history logic moved into `useDocumentEditor` / `useVersionHistory` hooks; the
  image lightbox is portaled to `document.body` so the panel's `translate-x` transform no longer
  clips it.
- **feat** Documents gained **search/filter** and explicit **empty / loading / error** states
  (`WorkspaceTabState`). Document load/error are now real signals threaded from
  `ChatInterface.fetchWorkspaceDocuments` (errors were previously swallowed); a failed load shows
  an error card with a working Retry.
- **feat** Visual modernization: tinted header, an icon-forward segmented tab bar (the active tab
  reveals its label so long localized labels fit the narrow panel), and per-tab count badges.

### Workspace — Runtime Evidence

- **feat** A single shared evidence source — `deriveAnswerEvidence` (`lib/answerEvidence.ts`) +
  `useAnswerEvidence` — feeds three surfaces so the same data is never derived three ways: the
  read-only **Knowledge / Memory / Outputs** tabs (latest answer), a compact latest-answer
  **`EvidenceChips`** row in the chat stream, and `MetricsPanel`. Clicking a chip opens the
  matching workspace tab.
- **feat** Evidence is gated to the active conversation via the `messages` array (last assistant
  message), so a backgrounded stream cannot bleed its evidence into the on-screen chat.
- **note** `MetricsPanel` deduped: the synthetic `knowledge_base` pseudo-tool is shown only under
  Knowledge Base, not also as a "tool".

### Workspace — Inspector (graph execution trace)

- **feat** New backend SSE event: `server.py` emits `event: node_state`
  (`{node, sequence, duration_ms, status}`) for every real graph node (enumerated from the
  compiled graph) on `on_chain_start` / `on_chain_end` / `on_chain_error`, with a monotonic
  per-request sequence and `perf_counter` timing. The `metadata` / `[DONE]` ordering is unchanged,
  and there is no GraphState schema change. Node enumeration tries two reflection sources and logs
  a warning rather than silently disabling the trace.
- **feat** The frontend appends these to an ordered `nodeTrace` (`useStreamingChat` →
  `ChatSessionContext`, `streamOnActive`-gated, and persisted in the assistant message's metadata
  (`_run_persistence`) so the trace survives a full conversation reload); the **Inspector** tab
  renders a semantic execution view — the ordered active path with per-node status + timing, total
  duration, a live indicator, the answer-path nodes that did not run this turn (the three
  mutually-exclusive tool-calling strategies collapse into one slot), and the post-response nodes
  that run after `[DONE]`. Per-node status is exposed to screen readers.

### Workspace — State Hygiene

- **feat** A small `WorkspacePanelContext` holds the panel's internal view state (the active tab,
  persisted to localStorage); the panel open/closed state also persists (SSR-safe restore). The
  Documents filter stays local to its tab so it does not leak across routes/conversations.

### Chat — Per-message Memories removed from MetricsPanel

- **change** "Memories used" is no longer shown below every assistant response. Memory provenance
  now lives in the workspace **Memory** tab plus the latest-answer chip. `MetricsPanel` keeps
  performance (time / tokens / tokens-per-sec / model) plus tools and RAG.

### Tooling / Tests

- **note** Frontend `tsc` + ESLint clean, **88** Jest tests passing (new suites for
  `deriveAnswerEvidence`, the workspace panel/tabs, evidence chips, and the Inspector), production
  build verified. `server.py` compiles. Streaming/session invariants (persistent
  `ChatSessionProvider`, active-conversation gating, queued follow-up, non-aborting navigation) are
  preserved throughout.

## [0.3.7] — more-frontend-improvements

### Chat — Math & Code Rendering

- **feat** Assistant answers now render **LaTeX math** via KaTeX (`remark-math` + `rehype-katex`,
  `katex.min.css` loaded globally). Inline `$x^2$`, block `$$…$$`, and the LLM-style `\( … \)` /
  `\[ … \]` delimiters are all supported — previously they showed up as raw text. `rehype-katex` runs
  with `strict: false` so imperfect model-generated LaTeX renders leniently instead of erroring.
- **feat** Fenced **code blocks are syntax-highlighted** with `prism-react-renderer` (synchronous, so
  no flicker as tokens stream in), gaining a language label and a copy button. The Prism theme follows
  the app theme (`oneLight` / `oneDark` via `useTheme`). The default language bundle covers
  js/ts/jsx/tsx, python, json, yaml, go, rust, cpp, markdown, graphql, swift, kotlin, objc; other
  languages (e.g. bash, sql) render as a clean themed-but-untokenized block — no global-`Prism`
  mutation or SSR hacks (kept deliberately simple).
- **feat** A production-safe `normalizeMath` preprocessor makes the above safe for a finance/tax
  assistant: it **protects code spans** (fenced + inline) from any transformation, **escapes
  currency dollar amounts** (`$5`, `$1,000.50`, `$5K` → `\$…`) *before* math parsing so they stay
  literal, then normalizes `\(\)`/`\[\]` to `$`/`$$`. Modeled on LibreChat's battle-tested
  `preprocessLaTeX`. Single-dollar inline math stays enabled because currency is escaped first.
- **note** `MarkdownMessage` was extracted from the 1300-line `ChatInterface.tsx` into its own
  component (`components/MarkdownMessage.tsx`), with the pure string preprocessors moved to
  `lib/markdown.ts` (kept free of ESM-only deps for direct unit testing). A shared
  `processOutsideCode` splitter ensures neither math nor footnote rewriting ever corrupts code
  content. 15 new unit tests (`lib/__tests__/markdown.test.ts`); `tsc`/lint clean; full frontend
  suite (64 tests) passing; production build verified. Frontend-only; no backend/API changes.

### Admin — RAG Knowledge Explorer (`/admin/rag`)

- **feat** New admin-only page to search the RAG knowledge base by keyword and review the
  matching chunks (text + source file + similarity score) for evaluation — there was previously
  no way to inspect retrieval outside of a live chat turn. Reachable from the Header nav (admin
  only) and nested under `/admin/`, so it is automatically covered by the existing `proxy.ts`
  middleware gate + `AdminOnly` guard.
- **feat** A single semantic search returns **all** hits sorted by score (no threshold cut),
  drawing the production cutoff (`pill_score_threshold`, ≈0.72) as a visible divider so the admin
  sees exactly which chunks the chat would keep while borderline/below-cutoff chunks stay
  inspectable. Each result shows score, source file, chunk index, language, and the full chunk
  text (keyword-highlighted, copyable, expandable).
- **feat** New backend router `backend/routers/rag_search.py` (sync `def`, threadpool):
  `GET /api/rag/search` (`q`, `top_k`, `collection`, `score_threshold`) and
  `GET /api/rag/collections` (names + `points_count`, so the admin can pick a target and confirm
  it is populated). Reuses the same embedding provider and Qdrant search helper as
  `node_retrieve_knowledge` (`search_qdrant`, `resolve_rag_config`,
  `get_routing_embedding_provider`) so scores match production. Explorer reads **system/profile**
  RAG config, not a user's session overrides. Embedding-provider, timeout, Qdrant-unreachable
  (`ConnectError`), and missing-collection (404) failures are mapped to clean 5xx/404 responses
  rather than surfacing as raw 500s.
- **note** Auth posture matches the existing `/api/admin/*` endpoints: protected by the shared
  `require_api_access` token, with admin gating enforced at the Next.js page layer (no per-request
  role check on the API). Frontend: `useRagSearch` hook, `/admin/rag` page + `RagResultCard`,
  `searchRag`/`fetchRagCollections` in `lib/api.ts`, EN+DE i18n. 11 backend tests
  (`tests/test_rag_search_router.py`); `tsc`/lint clean.

### Chat — Tokens/sec Metric, Block Cursor & Full-Width Reasoning Bar

- **feat** The expandable per-message metrics panel (`MetricsPanel`) now shows a **Tokens/sec** cell
  beside Input/Output Tokens — the exact output throughput of that response, computed as
  `output_tokens ÷ response_time_ms × 1000` and rendered as `<n>/s` (1 decimal, or rounded ≥ 100).
  Only shown when both values are present. EN (`Tokens/sec`) + DE (`Token/Sek.`) i18n keys added.
- **fix** The streaming proxy never persisted `response_time_ms` — `_run_persistence()` in
  `backend/routers/chat.py` saved tokens/model/tools but not the elapsed time, so the column was
  `NULL` for every message and the new tok/s cell (and any reloaded timing) couldn't be computed.
  It now persists `response_time_ms=int((time.time() - start_time) * 1000)`. Pre-fix messages have
  no recorded timing, so tok/s only appears on responses sent after this change.
- **feat** The live streaming cursor is now a **block** (`▌`-style, ~1 char wide) instead of the thin
  blinking pipe — wider span + softened corner in `ChatInterface.tsx`, same blink keyframe.
- **fix** The streaming **reasoning bar** (`ReasoningBox`) now spans the full message-column width from
  the first token (added `w-full`) instead of shrink-wrapping and growing as reasoning text streamed
  in — the parent assistant column is a flex `items-start` column, which sized the box to its content.
- **note** Frontend-only UI + one-line backend persistence fix. `tsc`/lint clean; verified live (E2E)
  that the tok/s cell renders (`19.4/s` for a 508-token / 26.1 s response). The composer bar was left
  unchanged (an interim tok/s chip there was removed in favor of the metrics-panel placement).

### Chat — In-Flight Stream Survives Conversation Switching

- **fix** Switching to another chat while a response was still generating, then returning, **cleared
  the inference** (the assistant answer was lost). Root cause: the `activeId`-change effect in
  `ChatSessionProvider` unconditionally aborted the stream (`cancelStream()`); since the FastAPI proxy
  only persists on `[DONE]` (`_run_persistence`, not in `finally`), the client disconnect tore down
  the upstream LangGraph request and **nothing was persisted**. (Page navigation was never affected —
  it doesn't change `activeId`.)
- **feat** A stream now keeps running in the background when you switch chats, bound to its
  conversation (`streamConversationRef` / reactive `streamConvId`). Returning **resumes the live
  stream** token-by-token, or shows the completed, now-persisted answer if it finished while away.
- **feat** Stream-derived UI (bubble, status, toasts, sound, context-ring) is **gated to the active
  conversation** (`streamOnActive`) so a backgrounded stream can't bleed into the chat on screen; the
  context-ring setter is guarded so a background completion can't overwrite the viewed chat's token
  count. The optimistic user bubble is restored via `streamMsgsRef`; the follow-up queue is preserved
  while its stream is backgrounded.
- **note** By design: sending a *new* message in another chat still ends the backgrounded stream
  (single concurrent stream); a background stream that *errors* while you're away is dropped silently.
  Frontend-only (`frontend/src/context/ChatSessionContext.tsx`); no backend change. Verified live
  (E2E) + `tsc`/lint clean + 49 frontend tests passing.

### Chats — True Server-Side Pagination + Search

- **feat** The `/chats` page now paginates and searches **server-side**, removing the previous
  200-row cap (it read the shared in-memory list). A new `useConversationBrowser` hook
  (`frontend/src/hooks/`) queries `GET /api/conversations?q=&limit=&offset=` directly with real
  paging; search filters across **all** chats, not just the loaded slice. Pagination now applies to
  search results too.
- **feat** `GET /api/conversations` gains an optional `q` — case-insensitive **substring** search
  over conversation title **and** message content (LIKE metacharacters escaped), returning an
  accurate filtered `total` and a `match_snippet` (the most-recent matching message excerpt; null on
  a title-only match) via a `LATERAL` subquery. Backed by **`pg_trgm` GIN** indexes on
  `conversations.title` and `messages.content` (extension/index creation is isolated + best-effort,
  so a low-privilege DB degrades to sequential ILIKE instead of failing startup).
- **feat** `activeConversation` is now resolved **by id** (seeded from the clicked row, else fetched
  once) instead of `list.find(id)`, so opening a chat beyond the sidebar's loaded slice keeps the
  Header meta + auto-title correct. A `revision` counter on `ConversationContext` (bumped by every
  mutator) drives cross-surface refetch so `/chats` and the sidebar stay consistent; single-row
  pin/rename/delete patch optimistically to avoid refetch flicker.
- **removed** The message-level `GET /api/conversations/search` route, its `SearchResultItem` model,
  `ConversationStore.search_messages`, and the frontend `searchConversations`/`SearchResult` — search
  is now unified into the list endpoint.
- **fix** `_memory_was_recently_retrieved` (`backend/routers/memories.py`) iterated the
  `(rows, total)` tuple returned by `list_conversations` (so it always raised and returned `False`,
  silently disabling the retrieval-quality signal) and guarded on the removed `search_messages`
  attribute — now unpacks the tuple and guards on `list_conversations`.
- **note** Backend `tests/test_conversations` updated (q filtering, snippet, pagination; `/search`
  tests removed) — 33 passing. Frontend 49 tests passing, lint clean, build green.

### Chats — Session Management Refactor + Archive Removal

- **feat** New **`/chats`** page (`frontend/src/app/chats/page.tsx`, linked from the header nav and a "See all chats" link in the sidebar) listing **all** conversations in a table. It is driven by the shared `ConversationContext` (single source of truth, so edits reflect live in the sidebar), sorted pinned-first then most-recently-updated client-side. Features: full-text search (`/api/conversations/search`) that narrows the list to matching chats with a message snippet; **multi-select** with bulk **Delete** and **Pin/Unpin**; inline rename; a per-row overflow menu (rename / pin / export JSON+Markdown / delete); and client-side pagination (50/page, hidden while searching).
- **feat** New `useConversations.bulkPin(ids, pinned)` (replaces the removed `bulkArchive`) and a corresponding `bulkPin` on `ConversationContext`.
- **refactor** The **sidebar** (`frontend/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`) is now a lean quick-access list — all pinned chats plus the **5** most-recent unpinned ones — and nothing else. Removed from it: the debounced full-text search, the multi-select bulk mode, and the archive view/toggle. The per-row action menu is kept (rename / pin / export / delete). The shared conversation fetch was bumped `100 → 200` so `/chats` effectively shows all chats; true server-side pagination on `/chats` (and search across >200 chats) is future work.
- **removed** The **archive** feature, end-to-end (it was unused): frontend UI/hook/types, the FastAPI `UpdateConversationRequest.archived` / `ConversationResponse.archived` fields and the `include_archived` list query param, and the `conversations.archived` Postgres column with all its SELECT/RETURNING/WHERE/normalize references (`backend/db.py`, `backend/routers/conversations.py`). `useConversations` also dropped `archive`/`bulkArchive`/`toggleArchived`/`showArchived` and a now-dead `showArchived` re-fetch effect. No migration needed (pre-production).
- **note** Frontend: 49 tests passing, lint clean, production build green (`/chats` route generated). Backend: full non-integration suite 1068 passing (archive-specific `test_conversations` cases removed). Pre-existing English-only default conversation title (`"New conversation"`/`"en"`) was left as-is (flagged, not in scope).

### Chat — Queued Follow-up Messages

- **feat** The composer is no longer locked while the assistant streams. The user can type a follow-up and **queue** it; when the current inference finishes normally it **auto-starts** the next one — no extra click. (`frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`, `frontend/src/context/ChatSessionContext.tsx`)
- **feat** Exactly **one** queued slot. While it is occupied the composer is **locked** (textarea disabled with a "Message queued — send or remove it first" hint) so a second send can't silently replace ("swallow") the queued message. The queued message renders as a dimmed "pending" user bubble at the bottom of the thread (ChatGPT-style) with a ⏳ tag; clicking it reclaims the text into the composer for editing (which also frees the slot).
- **feat** While streaming with the slot empty, the **Stop** button stays reachable; once the user has typed a follow-up an additional blue **Send (queue)** button appears beside it (Enter also queues). The textarea is enabled during streaming (placeholder "Type a follow-up…") until a message is queued.
- **feat** Auto-fire happens **only on a normal completion.** A manual **Stop** or a stream **error** keeps the message queued (the pending bubble stays put with explicit *Send now* / discard controls) so the user can read the error and decide.
- **feat** The queue is provider-owned session state (`ChatSessionContext`), so a queued follow-up survives in-app navigation just like the live stream, and is **cleared on conversation switch** so it never bleeds into another conversation (auto-fire is additionally gated on `streamConversationRef === activeId`).
- **note** Two runtime-timing subtleties drove the design: (1) `useStreamingChat`'s `wasCancelled` is set asynchronously (in `catch`/`finally`), *after* `setIsStreaming(false)`, so it is not yet true at the commit-effect render — a provider-owned `manualStopRef` set *before* the hook's cancel is used instead (`streamError`, by contrast, is reliable there); (2) the finishing turn's trailing `setLoading(false)` races the auto-fired turn's `setLoading(true)`, so auto-fire is deferred with `setTimeout(0)` to let prior state flush first. The pending bubble is intentionally kept **out** of the `messages` array (like the live streaming indicator) so it can't disturb message ordering, the persisted-id backfill, or the `replaceFromIndex` edit/regenerate logic.
- **note** Frontend-only; no backend/SSE/hook API changes. 49 frontend tests passing.

### Chat — Session Persistence Across Navigation

- **fix** A streaming inference was lost when navigating away from the chat (e.g. to `/memories`) and back — along with the user message that triggered it. `ChatInterface` was rendered only on `/` and owned the entire chat runtime in local `useState`; navigating unmounted it, which aborted the fetch (cancel-on-unmount) and destroyed all state, while backend persistence only happens at `[DONE]` — so nothing was saved.
- **feat** New persistent `ChatSessionProvider` (`frontend/src/context/ChatSessionContext.tsx`) mounted in `LayoutShell` (inside `ConversationContext`). It owns the live chat runtime — the `messages` array, the `useStreamingChat()` instance, `contextTokens`, `loading`, `sendMessage`/`ensureConversation`, the message-load-on-`activeId` effect, and the durable commit-on-stream-end effect (message append + `persistedId` backfill). Because the shell persists across route changes, the streaming fetch keeps running in the background and returning to chat shows the still-streaming or completed response.
- **refactor** `ChatInterface` is now a consumer of `useChatSession()` (composer + message list); it keeps only UI-local state (input, attachments, workspace doc, RAG toggle, menus) and the stream-end UX side-effects (sound, unread badge, workspace-writeback toast) which fire only while mounted. The cancel-on-unmount effect was removed; `sendMessage(text, opts)` now takes `{ attachmentIds, documentIds, ragEnabled, replaceFromIndex }`.
- **fix** Switching conversations mid-stream no longer bleeds the in-flight response into the newly selected conversation: the provider cancels the stream on `activeId` change and gates the commit on the originating conversation (`streamConversationRef`).
- **note** Frontend-only; backend persistence path unchanged. Out of scope: surviving a hard page refresh / tab close (the live token stream cannot be resumed after a reload).

### Context Window Indicator — Accurate Per-Inference Token Accounting

- **fix** The composer's context-window ring conflated two token scales. The streaming endpoint returned the real per-inference `input_tokens` when the provider reported `usage_metadata`, but fell back to `state["input_tokens"]` — a **cumulative lifetime sum**: the `respond` node accumulates `state["input_tokens"] += actual_input_tokens` and the value is checkpointed per `thread_id` and never reset, so it grows every turn. When usage capture failed, the ring jumped to that ever-growing total and could not represent actual context-window fill. (`universal_agentic_framework/server.py`, `universal_agentic_framework/orchestration/graph_builder.py`)
- **feat** `GraphState` gains `last_input_tokens` / `last_output_tokens`; the `respond` node writes them by **overwrite** (per-inference snapshot) alongside the existing cumulative fields (retained for analytics/budgets). `server.py` falls back to these in both SSE `metadata` emit paths and the non-streaming `/invoke` response, so the value the frontend receives is always the current inference's prompt size.
- **fix** Frontend ring now reflects **live context-window fill**: removed the `Math.max` high-water mark in `ChatInterface.tsx` (it could only grow, and locked in transient RAG/tool spikes and the cumulative leak). The ring follows the latest per-inference value, grows with history, and **drops after compaction**. Conversation reload restores from the **last** assistant message's `input_tokens` instead of the max across all messages.
- **fix** Ring denominator no longer falls back to `max_tokens` (the output cap) — dividing prompt tokens by the output budget produced a meaningless percentage. `maxContextTokens` resolves only to the true `context_window_tokens`; when unknown, `ContextRingIndicator` renders a raw token count (e.g. `12.5k`) with a neutral ring instead of disappearing, and the context-window popover opens regardless (Compact Context stays available).
- **fix** Per-message `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` persisted to conversation metadata are now per-inference, so `MetricsPanel` per-message token totals are no longer inflated by the cumulative leak.

### Context Window Override

- **feat** Optional `context_window_tokens` field on each LLM role in the profile overlay (`LLMRoleSettings` in `universal_agentic_framework/config/schemas.py`). When set it **wins** over runtime auto-detection (probe metadata / provider `/models`), guaranteeing a correct indicator denominator when the model is loaded with a smaller window than its max, the model is not loaded at probe time, or the provider does not report context length. Resolution order in `GET /api/system-config`: config override → probe metadata → `/models` map → null. Documented (commented) in `config/profiles/starter/core.yaml`.
- **note** LM Studio auto-detection already populated the denominator: `_fetch_model_metadata()` reads `loaded_context_length` (then `max_context_length`) from the native `/api/v0/models` endpoint into probe metadata. The override is a deterministic fallback for the cases auto-detection cannot cover.
- **test** `test_system_config_context_window_override_wins` confirms the override flows to `model_roles` and is not masked by `max_tokens` or absent auto-detection.

## [0.3.6] — docs-tools-frontend

### Role-Based Frontend Surfaces

- **feat** Two-surface frontend IA: **User** (chat, memories, personal settings) and **Administrator** (diagnostics, operational tuning, destructive maintenance)
- **feat** `AUTH_USER_ROLE` env var (`user` | `administrator`) embedded in the JWT at login; `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_USER_ROLE` used client-side when `AUTH_ENABLED=false` (dev mode); both wired through `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile.nextjs` following the existing `AUTH_ENABLED` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_ENABLED` pattern
- **feat** `UserRole` type and `role` claim added to `SessionUser` in `lib/auth/session.ts`; encoded in `createSessionToken`, decoded in `getSessionFromCookieValue`
- **feat** Middleware route guard in `proxy.ts`: `/admin` and `/metrics` require `session.role === "administrator"`; non-admin redirected to `/`; sub-routes protected via `startsWith` pattern
- **feat** `RoleContext` + `useRole()` hook (`context/RoleContext.tsx`): fetches role from `GET /api/auth/session` on mount; lazy-initializes state so dev mode (auth disabled) resolves synchronously — no nav-link flash; wired into `app/layout.tsx`
- **feat** `AdminOnly` guard component renders children only when `isAdmin`; suppresses fallback during loading to prevent premature "access denied" flash
- **feat** `/admin` page — "Setup & Administration" surface powered by new `AdminPanel` component: LLM capability diagnostics table (with copy-to-clipboard export), RAG collection + score threshold configuration, re-ingest documents, vision/auxiliary model selection, danger zone (reset all databases)
- **refactor** `SettingsPanel` trimmed to user-only controls: language, sound, tool toggles, RAG enabled + top_k, chat model preference; all admin controls extracted to `AdminPanel`
- **feat** `Header` nav links are role-conditional: Metrics and Setup links visible only to administrators; always-visible: Memories, Settings
- **fix** Both `SettingsPanel` and `AdminPanel` use read-modify-write on save — full `UserSettings` object hydrated from server on mount, only the page's own subset of controls is exposed and modified, complete merged object sent on save; prevents either page from wiping the other's settings on the backend (which does a full field replacement, not a deep merge)
- **remove** `/profile` → `/settings` redirect page deleted (no functional value)
- **i18n** `adminPage.*` keys (title, subtitle, llmSection, ragSection, modelSection, dangerZoneSection, accessDenied) added to type + EN + DE; `header.admin` added to type + EN + DE
- **test** `AdminOnly.test.tsx` (6 tests), `RoleContext.test.tsx` (9 tests), `AdminPanel.test.tsx` (5 tests), `SettingsPanel.test.tsx` rewritten for user-only surface (5 tests); 47 total passing

### User Data Management

- **feat** `POST /api/user/reset-my-data` — new endpoint in `backend/routers/settings.py`; deletes only the current user's data across three optional categories (`conversations`, `workspace`, `memories`); scoped `DELETE WHERE user_id = $user` (never truncates tables); also deletes user-specific file dirs (`root_dir/<conversation_id>/`, `root_dir/user-workspaces/<user_id>/`) and calls `Mem0._delete_all_memories(user_id=user_id)` for Qdrant; analytics, LLM probes, and the RAG knowledge base are intentionally untouched; `co_occurrence_edges` deleted under the memories flag
- **feat** Danger zone added to `SettingsPanel` — three labeled checkboxes (Conversations & Messages, Workspace & Documents, Memories) checked by default; "Delete Selected" button disabled when nothing is checked; full `ConfirmDialog` with "I understand" checkbox before commit; deletes only the current user's own data, not other users'
- **feat** "Clear All Memories" button on `/memories` page beside Refresh; reuses `POST /api/user/reset-my-data` with `memories: true` only; `ConfirmDialog` with requireChecked guard; on success clears local list/stats state, resets search box, and reloads; Refresh disabled while clearing is in progress
- **fix** `Mem0MemoryBackend._delete_all_memories` was calling `delete_all(filters={"user_id": ...})` which raises `TypeError` in Mem0 v2.x (installed: 2.0.1); now calls `delete_all(user_id=user_id)` first (v2 form) with a `filters=` fallback for v3+; the previous code had been silently broken since initial implementation — the `clear` graph node never actually deleted memories in production
- **fix** `logger.warning/info` calls with arbitrary keyword args in `reset_my_data` and `reset_all_databases` crashed under stdlib logging (`TypeError: Logger._log() got an unexpected keyword argument`); converted to `%s`-style positional format strings

### Map Tool

- **feat** `map_tool` — new LangChain `BaseTool` in `universal_agentic_framework/tools/map/`; three operations: `locate` (geocode a city, country, region, or continent), `distance` (straight-line Haversine distance between two places), `multi` (multiple pins on one map); Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) geocoder — free, no API key, `User-Agent: steuermann-ai/1.0` required per OSM policy; auto-zoom derived from Nominatim bounding box (city→12, country→6, continent→4); returns structured JSON with a `summary` field for LLM prose and coordinates for the frontend widget
- **feat** `map_data` field added to both SSE `metadata` event payloads in `server.py`; extracted from `tool_execution_results["map_tool"].data` so the full structured map payload reaches the frontend alongside the text stream
- **feat** `MapWidget` React component (`frontend/src/components/MapWidget.tsx`) renders inline in the chat below the assistant's text; MapLibre GL JS + OpenFreeMap tiles (free, no key, no account); `locate` shows a single pin (omitted for continent/world zoom ≤ 5), `distance` shows two pins + dashed indigo line + distance badge overlay, `multi` shows all pins with `fitBounds`; clicking "Open full map ↗" opens OpenStreetMap in a new tab
- **feat** `mentions_map` intent flag added to `detect_tool_routing_intents()` with intent boost (+0.2) for "where is", "where are", "map of", "show me the map", "how far", "distance from/between", "locate", and German equivalents; all trigger `map_tool` routing without requiring an explicit "show on map" phrase
- **feat** `MapData` / `MapLocation` TypeScript interfaces added to `frontend/src/lib/types.ts`; `map_data` field added to `MessageMetrics` and `ChatResponse["metadata"]`; `buildMetadataFromSSE` in `useStreamingChat.ts` extracts `map_data` from the SSE metadata event
- **feat** `map_tool` added to `FALLBACK_TOOLS` in `ChatInterface.tsx` and `SettingsPanel.tsx`, and to the fallback `available_tools` list in `backend/routers/settings.py`; per-session toggle and settings-page enable/disable work without additional UI code
- **deps** `maplibre-gl ^4.7.1` added to frontend dependencies; pinned to v4 — v5 introduced stricter null-checking in expression evaluation that is incompatible with OpenFreeMap's current `liberty` style format

### CLI & Docs

- **fix** `steuermann config validate` (no `--profile`) always exited 1 because `"base"` was included in the default profile list; `get_active_profile_id` rejects `"base"` as a runtime profile, which was surfaced as a validation error — removed `"base"` from the list; passing `--profile base` explicitly now returns a clean error message
- **fix** `steuermann config set` / `config unset` `--help` showed `core.llm.temperature` as the example key path; corrected to `core.llm.roles.chat.temperature`
- **fix** `config set --apply` / `config unset --apply` rewrote `core.yaml` with `sort_keys=True, allow_unicode=False`, destroying key order and escaping non-ASCII values; changed to `allow_unicode=True` with natural key order preserved
- **refactor** Removed unused `RoleProviderRef` class from `universal_agentic_framework/config/schemas.py` (leftover from earlier schema design, never imported or called)
- **docs** `docs/configuration.md` — replaced phantom checkpointing section (`enabled`, `backend`, `sqlite_path`, `CHECKPOINTER_ENABLED/BACKEND/DB_PATH` env vars) with the actual single-field schema (`postgres_dsn`); corrected all `score_threshold:` config key references to `pill_score_threshold:` (Pydantic field name; the old name was silently ignored at parse time); removed `FORK_LANGUAGE=de` from required env vars (not read anywhere in the runtime)
- **test** Removed 2 redundant CLI tests (`test_config_unset_apply_requires_confirm_token`, `test_config_unset_apply_accepts_interactive_confirm`) that mirrored their `config set` equivalents while testing the same shared `_resolve_apply_confirmation` function

### Workspace Sidebar — Image Lightbox & Document UX

- **feat** Image thumbnails in the workspace sidebar now open a full-screen lightbox on click (previously inserted a text reference); lightbox overlays at `z-50` with a dark backdrop, close button, and filename label; Escape key closes via `document.addEventListener`
- **feat** Full-size image loaded in the lightbox via the existing `/api/workspace/documents/{id}/download` endpoint; thumbnail in the card continues to use the `/thumbnail` endpoint
- **remove** "Reference" button removed from all document expanded-action rows (previously removed for images only in v0.3.5; now removed for text documents too); `handleInsertLiveRefCommand` and the `onInsertCommand` prop deleted from `WorkspaceSidebar`
- **fix** "Attach" button now always visible in expanded document actions regardless of whether an active conversation exists; previously gated on `{conversationId && ...}` making it invisible in blank-state; clicking Attach with no active conversation calls `onEnsureConversation()` (new prop, wired to `ensureConversation()` in `ChatInterface`) to create a conversation on the fly — same pattern as uploading a chat attachment

### Chat Composer — Attachment Pills

- **change** Attachment pills no longer toggle include/exclude state; clicking the pill body inserts `"filename" (id: <id>)` at the textarea cursor instead; insertion reads `el.value` directly (not stale `input` state) and repositions the cursor via `requestAnimationFrame`
- **remove** `selectedAttachmentIds` state and `toggleAttachmentSelection` removed from `ChatInterface`; all active attachments are always sent in the message payload (`attachments.map(a => a.id)`)
- **remove** "N attachments selected" count hint below the composer removed
- **remove** `selectActiveAttachmentIds` import removed (unused after selection state removal)
- **i18n** `chat.includeInNextMessage` and `chat.excludeFromNextMessage` keys removed (EN + DE + type); `chat.insertReference` added; `workspace.thumbnailClickHint` updated to "Click to preview" / "Klicken zum Vergrößern"

### MapWidget — MapLibre v4.x Compatibility

- **fix** Eliminated "Expected value to be of type number, but found null instead" console errors from the MapLibre web worker; root cause: MapLibre v4.x became strict about null values in ordered comparison operators (`>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`) where v3.x silently treated null as non-matching; the positron style's `boundary_3` layer and others use expressions like `[">=", ["get", "admin_level"], 3]` — features with `null` `admin_level` caused the worker to throw on every tile load
- **feat** `nullSafeFilter(expr)` helper added to `MapWidget.tsx`; recursively walks style filter expression trees and rewrites any `[op, ["get", "prop"], number]` pattern to `[op, ["coalesce", ["get", "prop"], 0], number]`; applied to all style layers after fetching the positron style JSON before passing to `new maplibregl.Map()`; map rendering is unchanged, only null feature properties are now handled gracefully

---

## [0.3.5] — vision-tools-expansion

### Workspace — Image & Document UX

- **feat** Workspace sidebar now accepts image uploads (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) alongside text documents; images are stored persistently in `workspace_documents` with `content_text = ""`
- **feat** `GET /api/workspace/documents/{id}/thumbnail` — lazy JPEG thumbnail endpoint (max 320×240); generated on first request via Pillow with RGB conversion (handles RGBA and palette-mode sources); cached on disk as `<stored_path>.thumb.jpg`; auth-protected; 404 if document is not an image or file is missing
- **feat** `DELETE /api/workspace/documents` — bulk-clear all workspace documents for the current user; removes DB records first (FK cascade cleans versions + `chat_document_refs`), then files and thumbnails on a best-effort basis; returns `{"deleted": count}`
- **feat** `POST /api/conversations/{id}/attachments/from-workspace` — links an existing workspace document to a conversation without copying the file; creates a new `conversation_attachments` record pointing to the same stored path; `AttachFromWorkspaceRequest` Pydantic model added to `conversations.py`
- **feat** Image file cards in the workspace sidebar show a thumbnail with file-size overlay; clicking the thumbnail inserts the filename reference at the chat cursor (replaces the Reference button for images)
- **feat** All file cards (images and text) gain an **Attach** button (visible when a conversation is open) that attaches the workspace file to the active conversation and shows an attachment chip in the chat input
- **feat** Upload area redesigned: 2/3-width upload button (now accepts docs + images), 1/3-width red Nuke All button with inline two-step confirmation (Cancel / Delete All)
- **feat** File size limit raised from 512 KB → **10 MB** for both chat attachments (`CHAT_ATTACHMENTS_MAX_FILE_BYTES`) and workspace documents (`WORKSPACE_MAX_FILE_BYTES`)
- **db** `WorkspaceDocumentStore.delete_all_documents(user_id)` added to `backend/db.py`
- **env** New env var `WORKSPACE_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (default `10485760`); `CHAT_ATTACHMENTS_MAX_FILE_BYTES` default updated to `10485760` in `.env.example`

### Vision Tools

- **refactor** Extracted four shared helpers (`_resolve_local_image`, `_build_data_url`, `_load_vision_api_config`, `_build_request_payload`) from `analyze_image/tool.py` into `universal_agentic_framework/tools/vision_utils.py`; all vision tools import from this module; `_build_request_payload` gains a `system_prompt` keyword arg that prepends a `{"role": "system", "content": ...}` message — used by OCR/document/chart tools; `analyze_image_tool` passes no system prompt (existing behavior preserved)
- **feat** `ocr_tool` — new LangChain `BaseTool` in `universal_agentic_framework/tools/ocr/`; accepts image URL or local attachment path; sends a fixed OCR-engine system prompt ("output only the extracted text, preserving line breaks, no commentary") and the image to `llm.roles.vision`; `max_tokens: 4096`; intent boost when image + OCR keyword present; auto-disabled when `llm.roles.vision` is absent
- **feat** `analyze_document_tool` — extracts structured JSON from invoice/receipt/form/contract images; input: `image_source` + `document_type` hint (`auto`/`invoice`/`receipt`/`form`/`contract`); output: `{"document_type", "vendor", "date", "total", "currency", "line_items", "notes"}` with `null` for absent fields; `_clean_json_output()` strips markdown fences from LLM response; intent boost when image + document keyword present; auto-disabled without `llm.roles.vision`
- **feat** `analyze_chart_tool` — extracts structured JSON from chart/graph images; output: `{"chart_type", "title", "x_axis", "y_axis", "series", "key_observations"}`; `_clean_json_output()` applied; intent boost when image + chart keyword present; auto-disabled without `llm.roles.vision`
- **feat** `image_metadata_tool` — extracts EXIF and file metadata from images using Pillow (`PIL.Image.getexif()`, public API); handles GPS IFD tag 34853 and decimal degree conversion; for remote URLs uses `httpx` to fetch bytes then feeds to PIL; output: `{"filename", "format", "mode", "width", "height", "dpi", "exif"}`; no vision LLM required — always available when Pillow is installed; intent boost when image + metadata keyword present
- **feat** `read_barcodes_tool` — decodes barcodes and QR codes from images using pyzbar; output: `{"found": bool, "codes": [{"type", "data", "position"}]}`; graceful `ImportError` fallback when pyzbar/libzbar0 is unavailable returns an error string instead of crashing; no vision LLM required; intent boost when image + barcode keyword present
- **feat** Vision LLM tool exclusion extended: `_VISION_LLM_TOOLS` set in `graph_builder.py` now covers `{"analyze_image_tool", "ocr_tool", "analyze_document_tool", "analyze_chart_tool"}`; all four are filtered from `loaded_tools` when `llm.roles.vision` is `None`; library-based tools (`image_metadata_tool`, `read_barcodes_tool`) are not in this set and load regardless of vision config
- **feat** Five new intent flags added to `detect_tool_routing_intents()`: `image_in_query` (image URL or attachment), `mentions_ocr`, `mentions_document`, `mentions_chart`, `mentions_image_metadata`, `mentions_barcode`; all new vision tools use compound boost conditions (image signal AND keyword signal) to avoid triggering the spread gate when multiple tools score close together
- **feat** All five new tools registered in `config/tools.yaml` (`enabled: true`), added to `FALLBACK_TOOLS` in `frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` and `SettingsPanel.tsx`, and added to the fallback `available_tools` list in `backend/routers/settings.py`; per-session toggle and settings-page enable/disable work without additional UI code
- **test** `tests/test_vision_utils.py` — 12 unit tests for shared helpers (data URL building, local image resolution with traversal prevention, request payload construction with/without system prompt)
- **test** `tests/test_ocr_tool.py` — 16 unit tests (input schema, sync/async httpx mocks, error propagation, tool registration)
- **test** `tests/test_analyze_document_tool.py` — 17 unit tests (includes `TestBuildUserPrompt` and `TestCleanJsonOutput` for JSON fence stripping)
- **test** `tests/test_analyze_chart_tool.py` — 16 unit tests (includes `TestCleanJsonOutput`)
- **test** `tests/test_image_metadata_tool.py` — 21 unit tests (includes `TestSafeValue`, `TestExtractMetadata` with mocked Pillow)
- **test** `tests/test_read_barcodes_tool.py` — 36 passed, 1 skipped (live pyzbar integration); mock strategy uses `patch.dict("sys.modules", ...)` to inject a fake pyzbar module for tests that run without `libzbar0` installed
- **ops** `pillow = "^10.0"` and `pyzbar = "^0.1.9"` added to `[tool.poetry.group.langgraph.dependencies]` in `pyproject.toml`
- **ops** `libzbar0` added to runtime apt dependencies in `docker/Dockerfile.langgraph` (required by pyzbar; builder stage unchanged — only the runtime image needs the shared library)

---

## [0.3.4] — auxiliary-model-expansion

### Auxiliary Model — Expanded Use

- **feat** RAG query rewriting enabled by default in the starter profile (`rag.query_rewriting.enabled: true`); previously shipped but gated off.
- **feat** Multi-query expansion for RAG — `QueryRewritingConfig` gains `num_variants: int` (default `1`); starter profile sets `num_variants: 2`; `_rewrite_query_for_rag()` in `rag_node.py` generates N semantically varied queries in a single auxiliary call; `node_retrieve_knowledge` batch-embeds all variants, unions Qdrant result sets, and deduplicates via the existing `filter_and_deduplicate()` helper.
- **feat** Conversation auto-titling — after the first full exchange (message count == 2), a background task calls the auxiliary model to generate a ≤6-word title and persists it via `ConversationStore.update_conversation()`; implemented for both the non-streaming (`/api/chat`) and streaming (`/api/chat/stream`) paths; fails silently on any error.
- **feat** Structured tool retry re-prompts via auxiliary — `node_call_tools_structured` resolves `retry_model = get_auxiliary_model()` once on entry; all retry iterations (force_tool_use, unknown tool name, arg validation failure) use `retry_model` instead of the full chat model; falls back to `chat` when auxiliary is unconfigured.

---

## [0.3.3] — vision-model-integration

### Vision Model Integration

- **feat** `analyze_image_tool` — new LangChain `BaseTool` in `universal_agentic_framework/tools/analyze_image/`; calls `llm.roles.vision` via direct httpx (same pattern as auxiliary model); accepts HTTP/HTTPS image URLs and local file paths from uploaded attachments; returns the vision model's analysis as a plain string; sync (`_run`) and async (`_arun`) paths both implemented directly with `httpx.Client` / `httpx.AsyncClient` to avoid event-loop conflicts inside LangGraph
- **feat** Tool is automatically excluded from `loaded_tools` in `node_load_tools` when `llm.roles.vision` is not configured in the active profile
- **feat** Intent boost (+0.2) applied to `analyze_image_tool` in `node_prefilter_tools` when an image URL (ending in `.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.gif/.webp`) is detected in the user message, or when image attachments are present in state
- **feat** `image_url_in_query` intent key added to `detect_tool_routing_intents()` in `intent_detection.py`
- **feat** `get_vision_model(config, language)` helper added to `orchestration/helpers/model_resolution.py`; mirrors `get_auxiliary_model()` pattern; raises `ValueError` if vision role is unconfigured (no fallback to chat)
- **feat** Attachment manager (`backend/attachments.py`) now accepts image MIME types (`image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`) and extensions (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`); binary null-byte check skipped for images; `extracted_text` is set to `""` instead of calling `extract_text()` for image uploads
- **feat** `build_attachment_context_block()` in `text_processing.py` extended to render image attachments separately from text attachments; image block shows file paths so the chat model can pass them to `analyze_image_tool`
- **feat** `analyze_image_tool` registered in `config/tools.yaml` (`enabled: true`) and added to `FALLBACK_TOOLS` in `SettingsPanel.tsx` and `ChatInterface.tsx`; tool toggles (enable/disable in chat composer and settings page) work via the existing `tool_toggles` JSONB mechanism — no additional UI code required since `systemConfig.available_tools` is built dynamically from the registry
- **test** `tests/test_analyze_image_tool.py` — 22 unit tests covering input schema, path-traversal validation, sync/async execution with mocked httpx, error propagation, and tool registration

### Image Attachment Pipeline (Bug Fixes)

- **fix** Upload returned 400 for image files — `extract_text()` in `backend/attachments.py` calls `content.decode("utf-8-sig")` and raises `AttachmentValidationError` on binary data; `conversations.py` now bypasses the call entirely for image MIME types: `extracted_text = "" if mime_type.startswith("image/") else attachment_manager.extract_text(content)`
- **fix** `analyze_image_tool` received a `MISSING_IMAGE_SOURCE` placeholder — `stored_path` was not included in the attachment dicts forwarded from `backend/routers/chat.py` to LangGraph; `build_attachment_context_block()` silently skipped attachments with an absent `stored_path`; fixed by adding `"stored_path": attachment.get("stored_path", "")` to both the streaming and non-streaming attachment comprehensions in `chat.py`
- **fix** `analyze_image_tool` received an `[IMAGE REQUIRED]` placeholder in structured mode — `node_call_tools_structured` builds an isolated `SystemMessage` that previously omitted the attachment context block; the model had no file path visible and generated a placeholder; fixed by appending `build_attachment_context_block(state.get("attachments") or [])` result to the structured tool-calling system prompt in `graph_builder.py`
- **fix** `Image file not found` at inference time — the `workspaces` volume was mounted only in the `fastapi` container; the `langgraph` container could not access uploaded files; fixed by adding `CHAT_ATTACHMENTS_ROOT` env var and `${WORKSPACES_PATH:-./data/workspaces}:/tmp/steuermann-ai/chat-workspaces` volume mount to the `langgraph` service in `docker-compose.yml`

### Vision Capability Detection

- **feat** `_detect_vision_from_model_entry(m: dict) -> bool | None` — new helper in `backend/llm_capability_probe.py`; inspects a single `/models` entry and returns `True`/`False`/`None` (unknown); covers all field shapes used by LM Studio, Ollama, and OpenRouter: `"type": "vlm"/"vision"/"multimodal"`, `"capabilities"` as list or dict, direct `"vision": true` boolean, and `"modality"` string containing `"image"` or `"vision"`
- **feat** `_fetch_model_metadata()` (replaces `_fetch_context_window()`) — tries the LM Studio native API (`{server_root}/api/v0/models`) first, which returns rich fields (`type`, `loaded_context_length`, `capabilities`); falls back to the standard OpenAI-compat path (`{api_base}/models`) for other providers; returns a dict with `context_window_tokens` and/or `supports_vision` (both omitted when unknown); native API uses `loaded_context_length` over `max_context_length` (actual loaded window); compat API uses `context_length` over `max_context_length`
- **feat** `supports_vision` added to `GET /api/llm/capabilities` response items — surfaced from `metadata.get("supports_vision")` in `backend/routers/settings.py`; `null` when the provider did not return vision information
- **feat** "Supports vision" and "Supports reasoning" rows added to the expanded capability detail in `frontend/src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx`; EN/DE i18n keys `detailVision` / `detailReasoning` added to `frontend/src/i18n/messages.ts`; `LLMCapabilityItem` interface in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` extended with `supports_vision: boolean | null` and `supports_reasoning: boolean`
- **test** `tests/test_llm_capability_probe.py` extended: `TestDetectVisionFromModelEntry` class with 11 tests covering all detection paths; `TestFetchModelMetadata` class with 4 tests using a dual-endpoint mock (native returns rich data, compat fallback, no-vision unknown, network error); total tests in the file: 19

### Chat Composer UI

- **feat** "Add Image" button in the chat composer is now functional — previously hardcoded `disabled`; wired to a dedicated hidden `<input type="file" accept="image/*">` with a separate `imageInputRef`; clicking opens the OS file picker; upload goes through the existing `handleAttachmentUpload` handler
- **feat** Workspace Reference button inserts at cursor position instead of replacing the textarea content — captures `selectionStart` / `selectionEnd` before inserting and restores cursor focus via `requestAnimationFrame`; browsers preserve selection positions after a textarea loses focus so reading them at click time is safe
- **feat** Edit and History buttons are hidden for image workspace documents — both buttons wrapped in `!doc.mime_type?.startsWith("image/")` guards in `frontend/src/components/WorkspaceSidebar.tsx`

---

## [0.3.2] — auxiliary-model-routing

### Auxiliary Model Routing

- **feat** `node_summarize` now uses the `auxiliary` role instead of the `chat` role — fact extraction runs on the lighter `gemma-4-e2b` model, freeing the chat model for user-facing generation; direct `.invoke()` replaces the Router-based `_invoke_with_model_fallback` call for this secondary task
- **feat** `ConversationSummarizer.generate_summary()` now uses `LLMFactory.create_auxiliary_llm()` when available; falls back to `create_llm()` for backward compatibility; `initialize_performance_nodes` now passes `LLMFactory(config)` so the summarizer is fully activated (was previously dead code — `llm_factory=None` always returned `None`)
- **feat** `LLMFactory.create_auxiliary_llm()` — new method returning a `ChatLiteLLM` for the auxiliary role without Router/fallback semantics
- **feat** `get_auxiliary_model(config, language)` — new helper in `orchestration/helpers/model_resolution.py`; mirrors `get_model()` for the auxiliary role; exported from `helpers/__init__.py`
- **feat** RAG query rewriting — new `_rewrite_query_for_rag()` helper in `rag_node.py`; rewrites the user query via the auxiliary model (httpx, sync) before embedding to improve semantic retrieval quality; gated behind `rag.query_rewriting.enabled` (default `false`); fails open (returns raw message on any error); invalidates the prefilter embedding cache when active to force re-embedding of the rewritten query
- **feat** `QueryRewritingConfig` schema added to `config/schemas.py`; `RagSettings.query_rewriting` field added with `enabled: false` default via `Field(default_factory=QueryRewritingConfig)`
- **config** Starter profile: `chat.max_tokens` reduced 32768 → 16384; `auxiliary.model` changed to `openai/google/gemma-4-e2b`; `auxiliary.max_tokens` reduced 32768 → 16384; `rag.query_rewriting.enabled: false` added
- **note** Compression threshold lowers from 24,576 → 12,288 tokens as a side effect of the `chat.max_tokens` reduction (`performance_nodes.py` derives threshold from `chat.max_tokens * 0.75`)
- **test** `test_generate_summary_with_factory` and `test_compress_conversation` updated to mock `create_auxiliary_llm()` instead of `create_llm()`

### Optional LLM Roles

- **feat** `auxiliary` role is now optional in `LLMRoles` (`Optional[LLMRoleSettings] = None`); both `get_auxiliary_model()` and `LLMFactory.create_auxiliary_llm()` fall back to the `chat` role when `auxiliary` is not configured — no config change required for profiles that omit it
- **feat** `vision` role is now optional in `LLMRoles` (`Optional[LLMRoleSettings] = None`); no fallback — callers skip the role gracefully; vision is not yet used in the graph
- **refactor** `LLMSettings._validate_roles` skips `None` role entries when building the provider registry; `get_role_provider_chain_with_models` raises a clear `ValueError("llm.roles.<name> is not configured")` instead of an obscure `AttributeError` when a None role is explicitly requested

---

## [0.3.1] — checkpointing-frontend-reasoning

### Postgres Checkpointing (Always-On)

- **feat** LangGraph checkpointing is now unconditional — `enabled` flag, `backend` field, and SQLite path removed from `CheckpointingSettings`; `build_checkpointer()` always returns a `PostgresSaver` or raises `ValueError` on missing DSN
- **feat** Load-at-edge pattern in `server.py` — both `/invoke` and `/stream` pre-fetch accumulated messages from the checkpoint via `aget_tuple()` and merge with the new user message before graph invocation; `GraphState.messages` (no reducer) is set correctly without ever overwriting checkpointed history
- **feat** Startup pruning (`@app.on_event("startup")`) and periodic fire-and-forget pruning every 100 invocations via `asyncio.create_task(prune_checkpoints(...))` keep checkpoint storage flat without new infrastructure
- **feat** Ephemeral sessions (requests without `conversation_id`) omit `thread_id` from `configurable` — LangGraph skips checkpointing entirely; no orphaned rows
- **refactor** `_load_conversation_history()` workaround removed from `backend/routers/chat.py` — function deleted, both `chat()` and `chat_stream()` call sites simplified to `"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": ...}]`; `ConversationStore.add_message()` calls retained for UI layer
- **chore** `CHECKPOINTER_ENABLED`, `CHECKPOINTER_BACKEND`, `CHECKPOINTER_DB_PATH` env vars removed from `docker-compose.yml`; `CHECKPOINTER_POSTGRES_DSN` default set to `postgresql://framework:framework@postgres:5432/framework`; `./data/checkpoints` volume mount removed
- **chore** `config/core.yaml` `checkpointing` block slimmed to `postgres_dsn` only; `.env.example` Prompt Configuration section added (was missing, all entries commented out)
- **fix** `GraphState.loaded_tools` and `candidate_tools` annotated with `Annotated[..., UntrackedValue(list)]` — `BaseTool` instances are not msgpack-serializable; their presence in plain `List[Any]` state fields caused LangGraph's `aput_writes` to fail silently on every turn, writing only the pre-node "input" checkpoint and never the post-assistant-message checkpoint; `UntrackedValue` excludes these fields from serialization while keeping them accessible within the turn
- **test** `tests/test_checkpointing.py` rewritten — SQLite/enabled-flag tests removed; new unit tests for `ValueError` on missing DSN, env-var precedence, config-DSN fallback; multi-turn integration test (`@pytest.mark.integration`) verifies second turn checkpoint contains messages from both turns; `pytest.importorskip("psycopg_pool")` added so the integration test skips gracefully when the `langgraph` Poetry group is not installed locally

### Context Window Ring & Token Tracking

- **fix** `input_tokens` fallback was always 0 when LM Studio omits `usage_metadata` — `_tokens_from_usage()` in `graph_builder.py` now accepts a `fallback_input_estimate` computed from the full prompt via `estimate_tokens()`; `node_generate_response` passes the pre-call character estimate so the ring reflects real consumption even without provider-reported usage
- **fix** Context ring denominator was `max_tokens` (response budget, e.g. 32768) instead of the model's configured context window — `LLMCapabilityProbeRunner._probe_target()` now queries the provider's `/models` endpoint and stores `context_window_tokens` in the probe `metadata` JSONB; `get_system_config` overlays this value onto `model_roles`; frontend uses `context_window_tokens ?? max_tokens`; `context_length` (configured/loaded value) is preferred over `max_context_length` (theoretical ceiling) everywhere
- **fix** Context ring went backwards between turns — per-turn prompt size varies because RAG results and tool outputs fluctuate; ring now uses a high-water mark (`Math.max(prev, tokens)`) so it never decreases within a conversation; `contextTokens` still resets to 0 on conversation switch

### Chat Metrics & Feedback Persistence

- **fix** Metrics panel lost most fields after navigating away and back — both `chat()` and `chat_stream()` `add_message` calls now persist `model_name` (dedicated column), `input_tokens`, `sources`, `rag_attempted`, and `rag_doc_count` into the `metadata` JSONB column; `toUiMessage` in `ChatInterface.tsx` reads all five fields back on conversation reload
- **fix** Context ring reset to 0% on navigation back — conversation load now computes the high-water mark from the reloaded messages' `input_tokens` and passes it to `setContextTokens` instead of unconditionally resetting to 0
- **fix** Thumbs up/down feedback not persisted for in-session messages — streamed assistant messages were committed to UI state without a `persistedId` (DB row ID never flowed back), so `handleFeedback`'s `if (msg.persistedId)` guard silently skipped the API call; after streaming ends, a background `fetchConversation` patches `persistedId` onto messages missing it (safe because `_run_persistence` on the backend completes before `[DONE]` is emitted to the client)

### Frontend UX Tweaks

- **improve** Toast notifications now stay visible for 6 seconds (up from Sonner's 4-second default) and include a close button for early dismissal — both `Toaster` instances in `LayoutShell.tsx` updated
- **improve** User message avatar replaces hardcoded `JS` initials with a `person` icon styled identically to the agent's `smart_toy` avatar — gradient background retained to distinguish user from agent
- **improve** Sidebar bottom section now displays the user's real name via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SINGLE_USER_DISPLAY_NAME` instead of the profile/app name ("Steuermann")
- **feat** Pressing `Tab` anywhere on the chat page focuses the composer textarea — document-level listener in `ChatInterface` intercepts `Tab`, skips interception inside `role="dialog"` elements so modal navigation is unaffected

### Streaming Reasoning / Chain-of-Thought UI

- **feat** `ReasoningBox` component (`frontend/src/components/ReasoningBox.tsx`) — collapsible box that renders model chain-of-thought above the assistant response; auto-expands with a spinner while the model is reasoning, auto-collapses when reasoning ends; click chevron to re-expand in completed messages; uses the same CSS grid collapse animation pattern as `MetricsPanel`
- **feat** Tag-parser state machine in `universal_agentic_framework/server.py` — intercepts `<think>`, `<thinking>`, and `<reflection>` tags from the LLM content stream before they reach the `token` SSE event; emits `thinking_start`, `thinking` (with `{"delta": "..."}` payload), and `thinking_end` events; pending buffer guards against tags split across chunk boundaries; longest-first tag matching prevents `<think>` from shadowing `<thinking>`
- **feat** Native `reasoning_content` path in `server.py` — when `chunk.additional_kwargs["reasoning_content"]` is present (LM Studio / LiteLLM field for models that separate reasoning natively), thinking is emitted directly as `thinking_start` / `thinking` events without going through the tag parser; the block closes automatically when content tokens start arriving; covers both LM Studio configurations (embedded tags vs. native field)
- **feat** `thinking_content` persisted to JSONB metadata in `_run_persistence()` (`backend/routers/chat.py`) — omitted from the dict when empty so pre-existing tests with exact metadata equality remain unaffected; read back via `toUiMessage()` in `ChatInterface.tsx` from `pm.metadata.thinking_content` on conversation reload
- **feat** `supports_reasoning` heuristic in `LLMCapabilityProbeRunner._probe_target()` (`backend/llm_capability_probe.py`) — pattern-matched against model name (DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Qwen3, Liquid LFM2, Phi-4-reasoning, Mistral Magistral, Gemma-4, Reflection, and generic `thinking`/`reasoner` patterns); exposed in `/api/llm/capabilities` response via `backend/routers/settings.py`
- **feat** `useStreamingChat` hook extended — `thinkingContent: string` and `isThinking: boolean` state; three new SSE case handlers (`thinking_start`, `thinking`, `thinking_end`); `isThinking` cleared in `finally` block (prevents stuck spinner on stream cancel or error); both values exposed in `UseStreamingChatReturn` interface
- **feat** `Message.thinking?: string` field added to `frontend/src/lib/types.ts` — set when a completed message has persisted chain-of-thought; `ReasoningBox` renders it collapsed in historical messages
- **feat** CSS grid collapse for reasoning box — `.reasoning-body` + `.reasoning-body.open` + `.reasoning-body > div` rules added to `globals.css` alongside the existing `.metrics-body` rules; same `0fr → 1fr` transition pattern
- **fix** `test_chat_forwards_attachment_context` — expected `metadata` dict updated to include `input_tokens`, `sources`, `rag_attempted`, and `rag_doc_count` fields that `_run_persistence()` has always written; test had drifted from the actual code

### Post-Release Bug Fixes

- **fix** `chat.py` streaming persistence: `str(None)` produced the literal string `"None"` as `model_name` when `model_used` was absent from metadata; corrected to `_metadata.get("model_used") or None`
- **fix** `llm_capability_probe.py`: `_fetch_context_window()` now logs at DEBUG on exception instead of silently swallowing all errors
- **fix** `graph_builder.py`: `_tokens_from_usage()` emits a DEBUG log when `usage_metadata` is absent and no `fallback_input_estimate` was provided, making silent zero-token fallbacks visible
- **fix** `useStreamingChat.ts`: `thinkingContent` is now cleared on stream error (when the stream terminates before any content is committed to a message), preventing stale reasoning content in hook state
- **fix** `ReasoningBox.tsx`: reasoning chevron now uses its own `reasoning-chevron` CSS class instead of borrowing `metrics-chevron`; corresponding rule added to `globals.css`
- **fix** `checkpointing.py` `_setup_via_autocommit`: migration loop now starts at `max(version + 1, 1)` so `migrations[0]` (which bootstraps the tracking table) is never applied twice on a fresh database

---

## [0.3.0] — frontend-streaming-chat-composer

### Context Window Ring Indicator

- **feat** `ContextRingIndicator` component (`frontend/src/components/ContextRingIndicator.tsx`) — SVG ring with `%` text showing real-time context window usage in the chat composer toolbar, left of the model selector; color bands: muted gray at 0%, evergreen up to 59%, amber 60–84%, red 85–100%; tooltip shows exact token counts; hidden when `max_tokens` is unavailable
- **feat** `max_tokens` added to every `model_roles` entry in `GET /api/system-config` — reads from `llm.roles.<role>.max_tokens` in the active profile (e.g. 32768 for the `chat` role); frontend derives the ring denominator from this field
- **feat** Real token capture via `on_chat_model_end` in `universal_agentic_framework/server.py` — fires once per LLM call with the fully-merged `AIMessage` including real `usage_metadata` from LM Studio; captured `input_tokens`/`output_tokens` override the state-derived fallback in both SSE metadata payload sites (respond-node fast path + drain fallback); streaming chunk capture (`on_chat_model_stream`) kept as secondary path

### Conversation Integrity

- **fix** Multi-turn context loss with checkpointer disabled — `_load_conversation_history()` helper in `backend/routers/chat.py` loads prior messages from PostgreSQL (`ConversationStore.get_messages()`, limit 20) and prepends them to the LangGraph state for every request; both `chat()` and `chat_stream()` paths updated; superseded by always-on Postgres checkpointing in v0.3.1

### Performance / Token Tracking

- **feat** Compression threshold now derived from `llm.roles.chat.max_tokens * 0.75` (e.g. 24576 at 32768 max) instead of the hardcoded 4096 token limit; `min_messages` lowered to 2 so compression triggers earlier; threshold computed fresh each invocation via `load_core_config()` in `conversation_compression_node`
- **refactor** Removed local tiktoken-based estimated prompt token floor from `node_generate_response` — `estimated_prompt_tokens` computation, `input_tokens = count_tokens_for_model(model_name, user_msg)` pre-call check, and `effective_input_tokens = max(actual, estimated)` floor logic all removed; `actual_input_tokens` from LLM usage metadata used directly for `state["input_tokens"]`; `count_tokens_for_model` is now only called in `node_summarize` for pre-call node_tokens estimation
- **refactor** Token budget enforcement removed from all graph nodes (`node_generate_response`, `node_summarize`, `node_update_memory`) — `require_tokens`, `TokenBudgetExceeded`, `get_budget_context`, `get_node_budget`, `get_response_reserve_tokens`, `per_node_hard_limit_enabled` no longer imported or called; `tokens_used` / `turn_tokens_used` / `input_tokens` / `output_tokens` state fields retained for observability and metrics; `test_summarization_budget_enforced` removed, budget monkeypatches removed from `test_graph_digest_chain.py`

### Test Fix

- **fix** `test_system_config_supported_languages_fallback_order` — `role_settings.max_tokens` raised `AttributeError` on mock `SimpleNamespace` objects, caught by the outer `except Exception` and silently returning the hardcoded `["en"]` fallback; changed to `getattr(role_settings, "max_tokens", None)`

### Scroll-to-bottom UX

- **feat** Auto-scroll now only fires when the user is already at the bottom of the chat; scrolling up suspends auto-scroll without losing the user's position
- **feat** Floating "Scroll to bottom" button appears when the user scrolls up and new messages arrive; shows an unread count badge (capped at 99+) for committed messages received while scrolled up; clears automatically when the user returns to bottom
- **feat** `useScrollToBottom` hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useScrollToBottom.ts`) — IntersectionObserver-based bottom detection, unread count tracking, `scrollToBottom(behavior)` util; conversation switches trigger an instant (non-smooth) scroll to bottom
- **feat** `ScrollToBottomButton` component (`frontend/src/components/ScrollToBottomButton.tsx`) — accessible (aria-live, aria-label, focus ring), keyboard-operable, smooth opacity + translateY transition, matches design system (evergreen fill, white font, rounded-lg)

### Chat Composer

- **feat** Chat input bar redesigned as a "composer": contained rounded box with textarea above a structured bottom toolbar, replacing the previous flat row of mixed controls
- **feat** Textarea defaults to 2 rows and grows line-by-line to ~10 rows (260 px cap) via JS `autoResize`; shrinks back to 2 rows after send via `setTimeout(() => autoResize(), 0)` post-`setInput("")`
- **feat** `+` attach button opens a popover with "Add file" (triggers file picker, functional) and "Add image" (disabled/greyed placeholder); popovers close on outside click via `fixed inset-0` overlay
- **feat** Tools icon opens a per-session tool-toggle popover listing tools from `systemConfig.available_tools` (falls back to `FALLBACK_TOOLS` constant); toggles persisted to `POST /api/settings/user/:id` as `tool_toggles` with optimistic local update; each row shows an ON/OFF pill aligned to the right
- **feat** Model selector in toolbar reads available models and default from `GET /api/system-config` (`model_roles[role=chat]`); displays current model with provider prefix stripped via `formatModelName()`; dropdown lists all available models with the active selection shown in bold; selection persists to both `preferred_model` and `preferred_models.chat` via `updateUserSettings`; `preferredModelsRef` preserves other role entries (vision, auxiliary) so a model change does not wipe them
- **feat** Inactive microphone icon placeholder (disabled, `cursor-not-allowed`)
- **feat** RAG toggle kept as 3rd icon in left group; state initialised from `fetchUserSettings` on mount alongside new tool and model state
- **feat** New state: `systemConfig`, `toolToggles`, `chatModel`, `availableChatModels`, `attachMenuOpen`, `toolsMenuOpen`, `modelMenuOpen`; new handlers: `handleToolToggle`, `handleModelChange`

### Composer Refinements

- **improve** Textarea focus: removed `focus-within:border-pacific-blue/40 focus-within:shadow-md` from the composer box — no blue border or shadow appears when clicking into the text field
- **improve** Send and Cancel buttons are now explicit `w-8 h-8 flex items-center justify-center` squares — icon is perfectly centred in a fixed-size 32×32 px colored background regardless of icon metrics
- **improve** Send button icon changed from `send` to `arrow_upward`
- **improve** All toolbar elements unified to 32 px effective height: icon-only buttons `p-1.5 size={20}`, model selector `py-2 px-2.5 text-xs`, send/cancel `w-8 h-8`
- **improve** Selected model shown in bold (`font-bold`) in the model dropdown for quick orientation
- **improve** All icons in `ChatInterface` unified to Material Symbols Outlined (`<Icon>` component); Lucide `Database` import removed; RAG toggle now uses `<Icon name="database" />`

### Model Resolution Fixes

- **fix** `resolve_initial_model_metadata` (`model_resolution.py`): `model_name` no longer pre-seeded with `preferred_model` — a stale or invalid preferred model can no longer leak into `model_used` in the SSE metadata when factory resolution fails; the variable now starts as `"unknown"` and is only overwritten on successful factory resolution
- **fix** `test_benchmark_1000_embeddings` speedup threshold lowered from `> 3.0` to `>= 2.5` — calibrated to observed hardware performance: NumPy-vectorised in-memory search at n=1000 is fast, and Qdrant carries localhost round-trip overhead that limits its relative advantage at this scale; 2.5× still conclusively proves ANN superiority over O(n) brute-force

### Streaming Performance

- **feat** Early `metadata` + `[DONE]` emission in `universal_agentic_framework/server.py` — SSE stream now emits the metadata event and `[DONE]` as soon as the `respond` node completes (on `on_chain_end` for `name == "respond"`), then drains remaining graph events (`summarize`, `update_memory`) in the background via `asyncio.create_task(_drain_remaining())`; MetricsPanel pills and source badges appear immediately after the last token instead of waiting 40+ seconds for post-processing to finish
- **fix** `_proxy_stream()` in `backend/routers/chat.py` — persistence helper (`_run_persistence()`) now called on `[DONE]` receipt rather than after the upstream connection closes; `_done_emitted` guard prevents double `[DONE]` emission in both normal and error paths

### RAG Fixes

- **fix** RAG `collection_name` warning false-positive — default value in `resolve_rag_config()` changed from `"framework"` to `None`; `rag_node.py` now checks `if cfg["collection_name"] is None` before emitting the warning and applying the hardcoded fallback; the warning no longer fires when a profile correctly omits the collection name
- **fix** `rag_node.py` TypedDict access — `state["messages"]` changed to `state.get("messages", [])` to resolve Pylance `reportTypedDictNotRequiredAccess` (`GraphState` has `total=False`)
- **fix** "Searching knowledge base…" node status indicator suppressed in the SSE stream when RAG is disabled (`rag_config.enabled = false`) — the `retrieve_knowledge` `on_chain_start` event is skipped in `server.py`, preventing a misleading status indicator during generation

### Chat UI Polish

- **improve** Send / cancel buttons redesigned as icon-only filled buttons — send: evergreen background, `arrow_upward` icon; cancel: burnt-tangerine background, `stop_circle` icon; `p-2 rounded-lg`; text labels removed
- **improve** MetricsPanel Knowledge Base row reads "N documents retrieved" instead of "N documents used" — `rag_doc_count` counts docs injected into the LLM prompt, not all cited sources
- **improve** Empty chat state simplified — template grid ("Explain a concept", "Help me debug", etc.) removed; only the `smart_toy` icon and "No messages yet" text shown

### Bug Fixes (continued)

- **fix** `useStreamingChat.ts` writeback race guard — `setFinalMetadata` updater in the `writeback` SSE case returns `prev` unchanged when `prev` is null, preventing a partial metadata object (`tokens_used: 0`, missing fields) if a `writeback` event arrived before `metadata`
- **fix** `useStreamingChat.ts` stale `toolCallStatus` — `setToolCallStatus(null)` added to the `finally` block; clears the last tool-call indicator after streaming ends regardless of how the stream terminates

### Developer / Tooling

- **fix** VSCode `reportMissingImports` false positive for `httpx` — `.vscode/settings.json` now sets `python.defaultInterpreterPath` to the Poetry venv (`${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python`) and adds `${workspaceFolder}` to `python.analysis.extraPaths`
- **test** `test_chat_stream_workspace_writeback_falls_back_to_sync` renamed to `test_chat_stream_workspace_writeback_uses_streaming_path` and rewritten to assert SSE streaming proceeds normally when writeback intent is detected (writeback is integrated into the stream after `[DONE]`, not a sync fallback)
- **test** `test_none_system_config_returns_none_collection_name` updated to assert `cfg["collection_name"] is None` following the sentinel change

## [0.2.9] — adaptive-rag-and-knowledge-base-toggle

- **feat** Intent-based RAG short-circuit: `retrieve_knowledge` is skipped for greetings, pure math/datetime queries (short + no web intent), and tool meta-questions — saves 50–80ms embedding + Qdrant round-trip per trivial turn; controlled by `skip_rag` key added to `detect_tool_routing_intents()`
- **feat** Per-session Knowledge Base toggle button in the chat bar — `Database` icon next to the attach button; state initialised from stored settings on mount; toggling persists to `POST /api/settings/user/{id}` without wiping `collection` or `top_k` values
- **feat** "Enable Knowledge Base" checkbox added to Settings RAG Configuration section — same `rag_config.enabled` field; save propagates to all subsequent chat turns via `rag_enabled` in `POST /api/chat`
- **feat** RAG activity row in collapsible per-message MetricsPanel: shows "N documents used" when docs were injected, or "searched · no relevant results" when Qdrant was queried but nothing passed the threshold; row absent when RAG was skipped entirely
- **fix** RAG document pill no longer appears when retrieved docs did not influence the answer — `SourceBadges` now gates `type === "rag"` sources on `rag_doc_count > 0`
- **improve** `_RAG_SKIP_SHORT_QUERY_CHARS: int = 35` named module-level constant replaces inline magic number in `intent_detection.py`
- **improve** `rag_config` user settings default extended to `{"collection": "", "top_k": 5, "enabled": True}` in all three locations in `backend/routers/settings.py` — prevents `enabled` being absent on first-run settings fetch
- **fix** Web search no longer silently skipped when a structured-mode model declines in plain text — `node_call_tools_structured` now injects a mandatory "MUST call" footer when `force_tool_use=True` (explicit web search intent or top candidate score ≥ 0.75) and retries with a stricter prompt when the model responds with text instead of a JSON tool call; up to `max_retries` (2) retry attempts before graceful exit
- **improve** `force_tool_use` flag added to `detect_tool_routing_intents()` return dict; set to `True` when `mentions_web_search=True` — keeps forced-execution policy centralised alongside other routing intents
- **refactor** `node_retrieve_knowledge` extracted from `graph_builder.py` into `orchestration/rag_node.py` — follows the `crew_nodes.py` / `performance_nodes.py` extraction pattern; `graph_builder.py` is now purely graph wiring with no node logic
- **refactor** Pure RAG utility functions extracted to `orchestration/helpers/rag_retrieval.py`: `extract_rag_keyword`, `search_qdrant`, `filter_and_deduplicate`, `resolve_rag_config` — module-level `_RAG_STOPWORDS` frozenset replaces per-call set construction; `httpx` and `re` moved to module-level imports
- **fix** `score_threshold` and `timeout_seconds` from user `rag_config` now propagate correctly through `resolve_rag_config()` — previously only `collection` and `top_k` were read from user settings, so user-configured thresholds were silently ignored and the client-side 0.6 floor was always used
- **fix** Embedding provider `_fallback` detection narrowed from `"$" in endpoint` to `endpoint.startswith("$")` — the broad check incorrectly activated deterministic fallback mode for any endpoint URL that happened to contain a `$` character
- **fix** `SettingsPanel` default RAG config state now includes `enabled: true`, consistent with the backend default (`{"collection": "", "top_k": 5, "enabled": True}`)
- **improve** RAG node exception handling split into specific `httpx.TimeoutException` and `httpx.HTTPStatusError` handlers before the broad `except Exception` — log messages now distinguish timeout from HTTP error from unexpected failure
- **improve** `logger.warning` emitted when `collection_name` falls back to the hardcoded `"framework"` default — previously this was silent and could mask missing profile configuration
- **test** 21 new unit tests for `rag_retrieval.py` helpers: `TestExtractRagKeyword` (5), `TestFilterAndDeduplicate` (5), `TestResolveRagConfig` (8) — includes regression tests for the `score_threshold` and `timeout_seconds` propagation bugs
- **fix** `_connect_with_retry` in `IngestionService` was defined but never called — `__init__` now calls it before `_ensure_collection()`, establishing the intended two-phase startup: wait for Qdrant to be responsive, then create/verify the collection
- **fix** `_ensure_collection` retry loop removed — startup races are now fully owned by `_connect_with_retry`; the simplified single try/except correctly propagates real `create_collection` failures instead of masking them with retries
- **fix** `chunk_overlap >= chunk_size` in `IngestionConfig` now raises `ValueError` at construction time instead of silently producing broken chunks
- **fix** Supported file extensions were hardcoded in three separate places (`service.py` parser dict, `ingest.py` file patterns, `DocumentEventHandler` event filter) — consolidated into `SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS: frozenset[str]` exported from `ingestion/__init__.py`; all three consumers now reference the single constant
- **fix** Lazy `from universal_agentic_framework.config import load_core_config` inside `resolve_runtime_ingestion_defaults()` moved to module-level imports in `cli/ingest.py`
- **test** 3 new unit tests for `IngestionConfig` chunk overlap validation: equal, greater-than, and valid cases
- **fix** `RemoteEmbeddingProvider.encode()` no longer silently falls back to deterministic hash-based pseudo-embeddings on provider failure — all exceptions now propagate after 3 retries with exponential backoff (1 s / 2 s / 4 s) for transient errors (connection refused, timeout, HTTP 503); `EmbeddingProviderUnavailableError` raised when retries are exhausted; `_deterministic_embedding` removed entirely
- **fix** Unresolved env-var endpoints (starting with `$`) now raise `ValueError` immediately at `RemoteEmbeddingProvider.__init__` instead of silently activating fallback mode
- **fix** `safe_get_model()` echo-model fallback removed — when the LLM provider is unreachable, the exception propagates through the graph node instead of returning a class that echoes the user's input; function renamed to `get_model()` to remove the misleading "safe" prefix
- **fix** `memory/nodes.py` `load_memory_node` and `update_memory_node` no longer silently fall back to `InMemoryMemoryManager` when the Mem0 backend fails to build — exceptions propagate so provider outages are visible in logs and frontend
- **fix** `rag_node.py` broad `except Exception` removed — `EmbeddingProviderUnavailableError` and other non-Qdrant exceptions now propagate; only `httpx.TimeoutException` and `httpx.HTTPStatusError` (Qdrant-specific) are caught and return empty context
- **feat** `IngestionService._wait_for_embedding_provider()` added — blocks service startup until a real encode call succeeds; mirrors `_connect_with_retry` for Qdrant; raises `RuntimeError` after 30 retries (~10 min cap); prevents documents from being stored with fake vectors
- **feat** LangGraph server startup (`server.py`) now probes the embedding provider with a real `encode()` call and retries up to 15× (~2 min); if the provider is still unreachable, startup fails with `CRITICAL` log and `RuntimeError` (container restarts via Docker restart policy)
- **improve** `caching/vector_backend.py` embedding init re-raises `ValueError` for misconfiguration instead of swallowing it silently; runtime connection errors still allow the cache backend to start with `_embedder = None`
- **refactor** All test files referencing `graph_builder.safe_get_model` updated to `graph_builder.get_model`; `test_vector_cache_backend.py` and `test_cache_performance_benchmark.py` marked `@pytest.mark.integration` (they require live Qdrant + embedding provider) and updated to use `EMBEDDING_SERVER` env var instead of the removed `$`-prefix fallback trigger
- **note** Ingestion watch mode: if LM Studio crashes while the watcher is running, files created during the outage will not be automatically re-queued. Run `steuermann ingest ingest` (full re-scan) after LM Studio restarts to re-embed skipped files
- **fix** RAG source pill labels now strip the 32-char ingestion hash prefix and display the full human-readable filename with spaces (e.g. "wichtige adressen darmkrebs krankheiten interniste" instead of "interniste"); same fix applied to the `[Quelle: ...]` label injected into the LLM prompt in the WISSENSDATENBANK block
- **feat** New `pill_score_threshold` field in `RagSettings` (default `0.72`, set explicitly to `0.72` in the starter profile) — documents below this threshold are excluded from both the LLM prompt and source pill display, preventing the LLM from citing context the user cannot trace; `score_threshold` (0.6) still acts as the retrieval floor for analytics (`rag_doc_count`)
- **refactor** Test embedding provider availability check consolidated from three per-file socket probes into a single `live_embedding_provider` session fixture in `conftest.py`; `EMBEDDING_SERVER` env var is normalised at conftest load time to remove duplicate `/v1` suffix when the var already contains it

## [0.2.8] — workspace-writeback-quality-and-admin-reset

- **fix** Workspace writeback LLM intent classifier rewritten to use a direct `httpx.AsyncClient` POST to the auxiliary provider's `/chat/completions` endpoint — `ChatLiteLLM.ainvoke()` silently dropped `api_base` in async context, causing every classification call to fall back to regex
- **feat** Writeback mode now uses a structured `SUMMARY:` / `DOCUMENT:` two-section response format — the model describes what changed in `SUMMARY:`, stores only the document body in `DOCUMENT:`; the chat confirmation message now includes the change summary; `_extract_writeback_summary()` and `_normalize_workspace_writeback_content()` updated accordingly
- **fix** `node_summarize` and `node_update_memory` now log a warning and return state gracefully instead of raising `TokenBudgetExceeded` — prevents 500 crashes when large writeback responses exhaust the per-turn budget before these downstream nodes run
- **fix** `list_document_versions` / `get_document_version` in `WorkspaceDocumentStore` now normalise `created_at` via `_normalize_version_row()` before returning — raw `datetime` objects caused a Pydantic validation 500 on every History panel open
- **fix** `handleRestoreVersion` in `WorkspaceSidebar` now calls `loadDocumentIntoEditor(docId)` after a successful restore if that document is currently open in the editor
- **fix** Reference button in workspace sidebar now inserts `"filename" (id: …)` instead of a full natural-language sentence, making it easier to embed in any prompt phrasing
- **feat** `POST /api/admin/reset-all-databases` endpoint added to `backend/routers/settings.py` — truncates 12 user-data Postgres tables (schema preserved; `user_settings` kept), deletes all Qdrant collections, and wipes workspace/attachment files from disk; returns per-subsystem status and error list
- **feat** "Reset All Databases" section added to the Settings page below "Knowledge Re-ingestion" — red button, requires typing `RESET` in a prompt dialog to confirm; EN + DE i18n

## [0.2.7] — workspace-tool-gold-standard

- **feat** Workspace intent detection replaced with a language-agnostic hybrid LLM classifier (`_classify_workspace_intent_llm`); fires only when workspace documents or text-MIME attachments are present; falls back to EN+DE regex
- **feat** Full document content injected into LangGraph in writeback mode via `workspace_writeback_document` state field, bypassing the 600-token context truncation
- **fix** `_normalize_workspace_writeback_content` changed from `re.fullmatch` to `re.search` so LLM preamble before a code fence is handled correctly
- **fix** Writeback system-prompt condition gated on raw `workspace_documents` list count, not the filtered context list — prevents empty documents from receiving writeback instructions without a content injection
- **fix** `_infer_workspace_document_ids_from_message` now skips the `list_documents` DB query when the message contains no UUID fragment, quoted filename, or "workspace document" hint
- **fix** `update_document` endpoint no longer recomputes SHA256 manually — uses `updated_metadata["sha256"]` returned by the file manager
- **feat** Version history: `workspace_document_versions` table added; `update_document_content()` auto-snapshots current content before overwriting; `GET /versions`, `GET /versions/{ver}`, `POST /versions/{ver}/restore` endpoints added
- **feat** Accepted file types expanded to `.txt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.xml` with per-extension MIME validation
- **feat** `PATCH /api/workspace/documents/{id}` rename endpoint added
- **feat** Frontend: version history panel with preview and restore; inline rename control; editor auto-reload after AI writeback save; active document propagated as `document_ids` in every chat request
- **fix** Settings `preferred_model` validation now runs on every save (not only when the field changes) — prevents stale unavailable models surviving partial settings updates

## [0.2.6] — tool-system-refactor-and-quality

- **fix** `file_ops_tool` disabled in `config/tools.yaml` — `sandbox_dir: ""` resolved to `/app` in Docker, giving the LLM read/write access to the entire application codebase; `WorkspaceFileOpsTool` (instantiated per-conversation in `backend/routers/chat.py`) is the correct production path for file operations
- **fix** `datetime_tool.convert_timezone` now accepts optional `time` (e.g. `"15:00"`) and `from_timezone` (e.g. `"Europe/Berlin"`) params — previously it silently duplicated `current_time` (both computed `datetime.now(ZoneInfo(tz))` and returned the same result); now supports real conversions like "what time is 3pm Berlin in New York?"
- **fix** `requested_web_results` from intent detection now injected as `max_results` into `web_search_mcp` tool calls in all three calling modes (native, structured, react) when the LLM did not specify it — previously the value was computed but never forwarded, always defaulting to 10 results
- **fix** `tool_name_map` hardcoding removed from `registry._get_description()` — now reads `default_tool` from the matching `config/tools.yaml` entry; adding a new multi-tool MCP entry no longer requires a registry code change
- **fix** Stale `entry_point: "src.main:app"` and `docker:` section (wrong image `web-search-mcp:latest` on port 9100) removed from `universal_agentic_framework/tools/web_search/tool.yaml`; actual deployment uses `mcp/duckduckgo` on port 8000 via `docker-compose.yml`
- **ops** Docker healthcheck added to `duckduckgo-mcp` service (`curl -sf http://localhost:8000/mcp`); LangGraph `depends_on` condition upgraded from `service_started` to `service_healthy`
- **refactor** `mentions_file_ops` intent detection removed from `intent_detection.py` and `node_prefilter_tools` (boosted a disabled tool); `file_ops_tool` references removed from `utility_tool_names` set and tool-result fallback list in `graph_builder.py`
- **test** `test_datetime_tool.py` updated for new `convert_timezone` output format (`"Time conversion:"` instead of `"Current time in ..."`); added tests for explicit `time` + `from_timezone` conversion and invalid time-string handling; added `DateTimeInput` schema test for new fields
- **docs** Updated intent boost table in `docs/tool_development_guide.md`, `docs/technical_architecture.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` (removed `file_ops_tool` row); updated Quick Reference tools table; updated `README.md` built-in tools list
- **refactor** Removed dead `node_route_tools` function (~155 lines) from `graph_builder.py` — it was defined but never registered with `add_node()` and had been superseded by the three-layer tool system (Layer 1 prefilter → Layer 2 LLM-driven calling → Layer 3 schema validation)
- **refactor** Removed helper infrastructure that was only used by the dead `node_route_tools`: `run_forced_tool`, `execute_semantic_scored_tools`, `build_semantic_tool_kwargs`, `prepare_scored_tools_with_forced_execution` (~300 lines across `semantic_execution.py` and `tool_preparation.py`)
- **refactor** Deleted `universal_agentic_framework/tools/sandbox.py` (254 lines) and `universal_agentic_framework/tools/rate_limiter.py` (242 lines) — both were fully implemented but never integrated into any execution path; sandbox/rate-limit enforcement can be added at integration time if ever needed
- **fix** `node_call_tools_native` no longer re-runs `detect_tool_routing_intents()` — it now reads `state["prefilter_intents"]` populated by `node_prefilter_tools` in Layer 1, eliminating a redundant embedding + regex pass per request
- **fix** `url_in_query` regex tightened: requires full URL scheme (`https?://`), explicit `www.` prefix, or a path segment on a bare domain — version strings (`v1.2`), file extensions (`.py`, `.json`), and email domains no longer trigger URL extraction
- **fix** `mentions_web_search` trigger narrowed: bare `search` and `find` removed; now requires explicit phrasing (`search the web`, `search for`, `look up`, `google`) to avoid false positives on `find the bug in my code` or generic `search` usage
- **improve** Tool YAML descriptions enriched for `calculator_tool`, `datetime_tool`, and `file_ops_tool` — added natural-language trigger synonyms in EN/DE/FR to improve cosine similarity scoring at Layer 1
- **test** Removed ~350 lines of dead tests: `TestSemanticKwargsBuilder`, `TestCalculatorExpressionExtraction`, `TestForcedToolExecutionHelper` (tested deleted functions); `TestToolSandbox`, `TestSlidingWindow`, `TestToolRateLimiter` (tested deleted files); `test_helper_namespace_exports.py` (tested deleted namespace distinction)
- **test** Fixed 3 URL-fallback tests in `test_semantic_tool_routing.py` to supply `prefilter_intents` in state, matching the updated `node_call_tools_native` contract
- **docs** Removed "Security: Sandbox & Rate Limiting" section from `docs/tool_development_guide.md` (referenced deleted `sandbox.py` and `rate_limiter.py` with dead code examples)

## [0.2.5] — probe-hardening-session-continuity

- **fix** `resolve_effective_tool_calling_mode()` now requires an exact `(provider_id, model_name)` match from probe results; previously fell back to any probe for the same provider when no exact match existed, silently applying the wrong model's capabilities
- **feat** New reason code `probe_model_not_found_forced_structured` emitted when probe data exists for the provider but not the specific model — distinguishes "no probe at all" from "wrong model probed"
- **feat** `LLMCapabilityProbeRunner.reprobe_for_model(model_name)` added — reprobes only providers whose configured model matches the given name; avoids a full reprobe on every model-change settings save
- **fix** `_trigger_reprobe_on_model_change()` in `backend/routers/settings.py` now calls the curated `reprobe_for_model()` instead of a full `run()`, reducing probe latency on settings updates
- **fix** `reprobe_model()` broken provider registry lookup fixed — was calling `llm_cfg.providers.get_registry()` which does not exist in the current flat role-based config schema
- **fix** Probe metadata noise removed — unprobed fields (`supports_streaming`, `supports_json_mode`, confidence, origin) were being emitted as `null`/`"unknown"` and displayed in the Settings UI; now only `probe_kind` and `max_output_tokens` are included
- **fix** `supports_tool_schema` removed from Settings capabilities detail panel — it was always identical to `supports_bind_tools` (both tested by the same `bind_tools()` call)
- **feat** `count_tokens_for_model(model_name, text)` added to `universal_agentic_framework/llm/budget.py` using `litellm.token_counter()` with tiktoken model-aware counting; falls back to `estimate_tokens()` character approximation on exception
- **fix** `respond_node` and `summarize_node` in `graph_builder.py` now use `count_tokens_for_model()` for input-token accounting instead of the character-estimate approximation
- **feat** "Memories used" UI folded into MetricsPanel — the always-expanded `MemoryUsedList` above each assistant message is removed; memory count now appears as a chip in the collapsed MetricsPanel summary line and as an expandable section inside the panel body; no new CSS required
- **fix** `POST /api/chat` now forwards `conversation_id` to LangGraph as `session_id` — the LangGraph checkpointer uses `session_id` as `thread_id`, so all turns within the same `conversation_id` now share graph state and conversation history; previously every request started a fresh thread regardless of `conversation_id`
- **fix** E2E memory inference test (`tests/test_live_memory_inference_e2e.py`) hardened: stale-memory cleanup now covers both `SHORT_TOKEN` and `LONG_TOKEN` prefixes; conversation isolation uses dedicated UUIDs (`conv_store` for storage turns, `conv_recall` for cross-session recall); storage instruction framing improved for reliable Mem0 fact extraction; short-recall sleep increased to 2 s
- **test** `tests/test_graph_builder_fallback.py` updated for simplified `invoke_with_model_fallback()` — replaced obsolete candidate-expansion-loop tests with error classification (generic error → `error_type="error"`) and LiteLLM context-window classification tests
- **test** `tests/test_reprobe_triggers.py` updated to verify curated `reprobe_for_model()` behavior — mock exposes the method and assertions confirm curated reprobe is called (not a full run) on model change

## [0.2.4] — active-profile-provider-cutover

- **break** Ingestion runtime settings now resolve from the active profile only; `.env`/Compose keep only deployment wiring, and `rag.collection_name` is now the single collection owner
- **break** Runtime provider/model ownership moved fully to `config/profiles/<profile_id>/core.yaml`; `PROFILE_ID` is now required and `base` is no longer a runnable profile id
- **break** Legacy `providers.primary` / `providers.fallback` assumptions removed from runtime consumers and test fixtures; role-based provider chains are now the only supported contract
- **feat** `LLMFactory.get_router_model()` now forwards profile-owned LiteLLM router policy from `llm.router` (retry, routing strategy, default parallelism)
- **fix** `backend/routers/chat.py` provider endpoint resolution now uses only the active profile's named provider registry; the final fallback to legacy `providers.primary` was removed
- **fix** `backend/routers/settings.py`, ingestion CLI/runtime defaults, tool-calling mode resolution, crews, memory backend construction, and model-resolution helpers now resolve behavior from the active profile and named provider roles instead of legacy aliases or env-owned ingestion knobs
- **fix** `.env` and `.env.example` now quote space-containing values so they can be sourced cleanly by POSIX shells and `zsh`
- **docs** Updated `README.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/ingestion.md`, `docs/technical_architecture.md`, `docs/status.md`, and `.github/ARCHITECTURE.md` for active-profile-only provider/model/ingestion configuration
- **test** Completed remaining legacy test cleanup, added direct chat endpoint resolution coverage, and validated the final cutover with focused regressions plus live stack smoke checks
- **feat** Added profile-level Mem0 extraction toggle `memory.mem0.infer_enabled` and wired it through schema, loader allowlist, memory factory, and backend behavior
- **fix** Mem0 extraction path now supports bounded infer payload compaction and robust fallback while preserving upsert continuity
- **ops** Re-enabled Mem0 infer for starter profile after increasing chat/auxiliary max tokens to `32768`
- **fix** CLI contract parity restored by adding `memory.mem0` to `config/contracts/cli_contract.yaml` `profile_safety.allowed_core_prefixes`
- **fix** `universal_agentic_framework/orchestration/helpers/model_resolution.py` typing import now includes `List` for fallback attempt annotations
- **fix** Frontend type-contract regression resolved in `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useProfile.test.tsx` by adding required `model_roles` mock field
- **docs** Synced README, status snapshot, and architecture/configuration docs for Mem0 infer toggle, auxiliary-model wiring, and contract parity
- **feat** Added message-quality telemetry pipeline: Prometheus counter for assistant thumbs feedback, analytics endpoint `/api/analytics/message-quality`, frontend `MessageQualityPanel`, and EN/DE i18n wiring in Metrics Trends
- **ops** Phase 8 verification completed: authenticated API smoke checks, message feedback write-path validation, Prometheus metric verification, docs drift check, and no-cache container rebuild/health validation
- **refactor** Mem0 adapter de-customization slices: enforce filters-based Mem0 search/list/delete API, switch to canonical OSS `get/delete/update` signatures, and remove redundant adapter `_text_cache`
- **refactor** Continued Mem0 adapter de-customization: removed `_owner_cache` and derive ownership from canonical Mem0 item fields/metadata (`user_id`) for lookup/delete/rating flows
- **refactor** Continued Mem0 adapter de-customization: removed `_metadata_cache` and `_rating_overrides`; metadata/rating consistency now relies on canonical Mem0 metadata normalization and canonical `update(memory_id, data=..., metadata=...)` persistence only
- **ops** Phase 3.5 memory-layer de-customization marked complete after final cache-layer removal, full regression pass, docs drift check, and no-cache backend image rebuild/recreate
- **test** Added regression coverage to lock the current Mem0 OSS adapter contract and validated full suite (`950 passed, 5 skipped`)
- **test** Added repeatable live stack E2E memory inference test (`tests/test_live_memory_inference_e2e.py`) covering short-term recall, long-term persistence (`/api/memories`), and long-term recall via `/api/chat`
- **docs** Updated README, monitoring, status, and architecture docs for message-quality telemetry and latest Mem0 adapter contract cleanup

## [0.2.3] — provider-endpoint-consolidation

- **break** `LLM_ENDPOINT` removed entirely; replaced by per-provider env vars `LLM_PROVIDERS_LMSTUDIO_API_BASE`, `LLM_PROVIDERS_OLLAMA_API_BASE`, `LLM_PROVIDERS_OPENROUTER_API_BASE` — update `.env` accordingly
- **fix** `langchain-litellm` added to FastAPI dependency group — capability probes now run successfully at startup (root cause: tools were discovered but never executed because probe results were unavailable)
- **fix** `server.py` state construction now forwards `llm_capability_probes` from the LangGraph request payload — mode reason advances from `configured_native_no_probe` to `configured_native_probe_ok`
- **fix** Fallback deduplication in `model_resolution.py` changed from `(provider, model, source)` to `(provider, model)` — prevents the same candidate being retried twice
- **feat** `config/core.yaml` provider `api_base` values interpolate from new provider-specific env vars rather than a single `LLM_ENDPOINT`
- **fix** `config/profiles/starter/core.yaml` aligned with base config: provider `api_base` now resolves from `LLM_PROVIDERS_*_API_BASE` env vars and LM Studio model IDs use canonical `openai/...` prefix
- **feat** `backend/routers/chat.py` resolves provider endpoint strictly from active provider config — no legacy fallback
- **feat** `backend/routers/settings.py` `/api/models` endpoint resolves from primary provider config — no legacy fallback
- **feat** `docker-compose.yml` injects `LLM_PROVIDERS_*_API_BASE` vars into all affected services; `WEB_SEARCH_MCP_URL` parameterised via env var
- **improve** `steuermann setup doctor` checks for provider-specific endpoint vars and probes each configured endpoint individually (was single `LLM_ENDPOINT` check)
- **improve** `.env.example` and `docs/configuration.md` updated to reflect new provider-specific env var naming; `LLM_ENDPOINT` references removed
- **improve** `docs/monitoring.md`, `docs/technical_architecture.md`, and `docs/status.md` aligned with provider-specific endpoint env vars
- **test** Updated endpoint-related fixtures/assertions in `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/test_config_loader.py`, `tests/test_langgraph_builder.py`, `tests/test_tool_invocation.py`, `tests/test_docker_compose_ingestion_env.py`, and `tests/test_steuermann_cli.py`
- **feat** Tool-calling policy moved to model-level config via `model_tool_calling` map per provider; provider-level `tool_calling` removed from runtime decision path
- **feat** Probe-authoritative mode resolution with freshness enforcement: stale/missing/invalid probe timestamps force `structured`; fresh successful probe is required for `native`
- **feat** New settings API endpoint `GET /api/llm/capabilities` exposing per-model desired mode, effective mode, probe status, and capability metadata
- **feat** Frontend Settings page now displays model capability status table with native/structured/react legend badges and an inline refresh action
- **feat** Added "Copy diagnostics" action in Settings capability panel to export probe TTL and per-model capability rows as tab-delimited clipboard output
- **feat** Capabilities table now supports per-model expandable details (configured mode, API base, bind/schema flags, mismatch flag, probe error, raw metadata)
- **feat** Settings now supports role-based model preferences (`preferred_models`) with provider-locked selectors per configured role (chat/embedding/vision/auxiliary)
- **feat** `/api/system-config` now includes `model_roles` entries (role, fixed provider, default model, role-scoped available models, optional model load error)
- **fix** User settings persistence now stores `preferred_models` JSON alongside legacy `preferred_model` and keeps chat preference synchronized for runtime compatibility
- **feat** Added configurable probe freshness env var `LLM_CAPABILITY_PROBE_TTL_SECONDS` (default `3600`) to `.env` and `.env.example`
- **fix** Chat router now forwards latest capability probe rows per provider+model (not collapsed per provider), enabling correct model-level mode resolution
- **docs** Updated `docs/configuration.md`, `docs/tool_development_guide.md`, and `docs/technical_architecture.md` for model-level tool-calling and probe freshness behavior

## [0.2.2] — provider-model-hardening

- **fix** Model validation in `_validate_preferred_model` now derives provider prefix from the requested model ID, not the active profile's default — prevents `openrouter/...` being silently re-prefixed as `openai/...`
- **fix** Settings `POST /api/settings/user/{user_id}` preserves raw preferred model values; only normalizes IDs that already carry a recognized provider prefix
- **feat** `openrouter` recognised as a valid provider prefix throughout chat and settings validation layers
- **fix** LangGraph response handler normalizes list/dict-shaped content blocks (e.g. OpenRouter structured output) to plain text, preventing "LLM returned unexpected list" runtime errors
- **improve** `.env` and `.env.example` restructured with an explicit LLM provider section containing annotated examples for local Ollama, local LM Studio, and OpenRouter.ai
- **feat** `LLM_CAPABILITY_PROBE_ENABLED` and `LLM_CAPABILITY_PROBE_ON_STARTUP` env vars documented in `.env.example`, `.env`, and `docs/configuration.md`
- **test** Direct unit tests for `normalize_model_id` and `parse_model_id` with three-part `openai/<org>/<model>` IDs

## [0.2.1] — improved-config-flow

- **feat** Unified `steuermann` CLI with 16 commands: `profile` (active, scaffold, bundle export/import), `config` (show, explain, validate, set, unset, contract-check), `setup doctor`, `docs check`, `ingest` (ingest, watch, validate, reindex)
- **break** Profile commands now use profile IDs instead of paths: `profile scaffold --from starter --profile X` (was `--to config/profiles/X --profile-id X`)
- **feat** Profile bundling: export/import `.tar.gz` bundles with schema/framework/key compatibility validation
- **feat** Profile-safe config mutations with guardrails: `config set/unset` with dry-run, `--apply --confirm APPLY`, rollback, TTY fallback
- **feat** Configuration contract registry (`config/contracts/cli_contract.yaml`) ensures CLI/docs/code stay in sync
- **feat** `config validate` checks schema, files, env placeholders, and contract parity
- **feat** `setup doctor` preflight checks for env vars, endpoints, profile alignment with optional probing
- **feat** `docs check` validates documentation conformance and categorizes drift by domain (docs, contract, bundle-compat)
- **fix** Profile scaffold no longer writes bundle metadata to profile.yaml (moved to bundle_manifest.yaml only)
- **fix** Python 3.14 compatibility: tarfile.extractall() now uses filter="data" parameter
- **fix** YAML loading in ingest.py now has error handling with clear messages for malformed/missing files
- **fix** Ingestion logging: replaced print() with structured logger calls
- **improve** .env and .env.example aligned with APP_UID, APP_GID, CHECKPOINTER_POSTGRES_DSN, WEB_SEARCH_MCP_URL
- **improve** .gitignore updated to exclude custom profiles (keep starter template tracked)
- **improve** Bundle manifest includes explicit manifest_version field for future migrations
- **docs** New comprehensive docs/cli.md (400+ lines) with command reference, workflows, guardrails
- **docs** Updated profile_creation.md, configuration.md (LM Studio/Ollama guidance), ingestion.md (28 refs), README.md, copilot-instructions.md
- **test** Added 1096 CLI tests covering all 16 steuermann commands (871 passed, 5 skipped)

## [0.2] — refactor-memory-layer

- **perf** Singleton-cache `Mem0MemoryBackend` in factory — eliminates redundant Qdrant index round-trips per request
- **fix** Switch Mem0 LLM provider to `lmstudio` to avoid LM Studio `json_object` 400 errors; `infer=True` now works natively
- **feat** Structured multi-message exchange passed to Mem0 `upsert` for richer inference context
- **feat** Graceful `infer=False` verbatim fallback when Mem0 returns silent empty response
- **feat** Memory retrieval quality feedback loop — Prometheus counters + `/api/analytics/memory-retrieval-quality` endpoint + `RetrievalFeedbackPanel` in frontend
- **feat** User ratings persist across cache resets
- **feat** `MemoryTrendsChart` and `MemoryMetricsPanel` components added to metrics dashboard
- **feat** Dedicated `/memories` page with listing, stats, and rating UI
- **feat** Memory management API — list, retrieve, delete with user access control
- **feat** Tool prefiltering enforces web search intent override
- **refactor** Replace Qdrant backend with Mem0 OSS embedded backend; add integration tests

## [0.1] — unify-llm-handling-architecture

- **feat** Disable multi-agent crews by default in config
- **fix** Increase LangGraph request timeout; improve Redis health check
- **feat** All LangChain `BaseTool` subclasses auto-wrapped as CrewAI tools (not just `MCPServerTool`)
- **feat** Crew results injected into LLM system prompt as `=== RESEARCH FINDINGS ===`
- **feat** Date anchoring in system prompt (`[Today: YYYY-MM-DD]`) and crew task context
- **refactor** Unified LLM integration via LangChain/LiteLLM; update model aliases and configs

## [0.0] — initial

- **feat** Initial framework: LangGraph orchestration, FastAPI adapter, Next.js frontend, Docker Compose stack
- **feat** Linux compatibility — `APP_UID`/`APP_GID` support in Dockerfiles
